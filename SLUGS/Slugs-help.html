    <p><h2 id="sec1">1.0: Overview</h2>

    <p><code>SLUGS</code> is a computer-based system for converting a
      cloud of points into a static Boundary Representation (BRep).
      The <code>SLUGS</code> program is built using a client-server
      architecture.

    <p>The server consists of a back-end program (<code>Slugs</code>)
       that performs the majority of the computational work; the
       server has been designed to work on a variety of compute
       platforms, including UNIX, LINUX, OSX, and Windows.  As will be
       described below, the user of <code>SLUGS</code> typically
       starts a session by starting the server.

    <p>The client, which is built within a web browser, provides the
       graphical user interface with which most users will provide
       inputs and receive outputs.  The supported browsers include
       recent versions of FireFox, Google Chrome, and Safari.
       (Internet Explorer is not supported because of a bug within the
       WebSockets layer provided by the browser).

    <p>The input file to <code>SLUGS</code> is a stereo-lithography
      file (<code>.stl</code>). The triangles in the <code>.stl</code>
      do not need to represent a watertight solid;
      the </code>.stl</code> file can include (partially) unconnected
      triangles.

    <p>The output of <code>SLUGS</code> is a <code>.egads</code> BRep
      file, that consists of Faces that are either:
      <ul>
        <li>planar Faces, with any number of bounding Edges and any
          number of interior holes, and</li>
        <li>non-planar Faces that have exactly four (4) bounding
          Edges.</li>
      </ul>
      The hardest part of using <code>SLUGS</code> involves the design
      of the BRep that meets the above requirements.

    <p>The output BRep is considered to be "static" in that it
      represents a Body that is not parameterized; that is, the output
      BRep can be used as a fixed Body that can be "imported" into
      the <code>ESP</code> system, but it cannot be parametrically
      modified.

    <p>The user of <code>SLUGS</code> performs the transformation from
      the <code>.stl</code> file to the <code>.egads</code> file using
      the following steps:
      <ul>
        <li>(Optionally) repair the input triangulation by filling in
          gaps and removing overlaps.  This step is not in general
          required, but such repairs may make the some of the
          following operations a bit simpler.</li>
        <li>Create "links" of triangle sides that will eventually
          correspond to the Edges in the output BRep.  The linking
          operation can be done in a variety of ways:
          <ul>
            <li>by automatically "marking" triangle sides with a
              dihedral angle greater that some user-specified
              angle;</li>
            <li>by following the shortest path along triangle sides
              between the user-specified "point" and "target"; or</li>
            <li>by "scribing" the triangulation between a
              user-specified "point" and "target" (this operation
              splits the triangles that are scribed).</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Color the triangles such that each color corresponds with
          one of the Faces in the output BRep.  This operation is done
          by selecting a triangle to color; <code>SLUGS</code>
          automatically colors all triangles that are adjacent to the
          chosen triangle (but not across a "link").</li>
        <li>Automatically create the BRep.</li>
      </ul>

    <p><h2 id="sec2">2.0: Tutorials</h2>

    <p>The following tutorial has been designed to walk a
       new <code>SLUGS</code> user through the basic capabilities that
       are available through the user interface.

    <p><h3 id="sec2.1">2.1 First tutorial: Basic usage</h3>

    <p>This tutorial will help you understand the use of
       <code>SLUGS</code>.  Details about the <a href="#sec3">Command
       Line</a> and <a href="#sec4">cursor and keyboard options</a>
       are contained in sections that follow this tutorial.

    <p>The tutorial starts with a pre-made part that is defined by the
       file <code>tutorial1.stl</code>.

    <p>To start <code>SLUGS</code> there are two steps: (1) start the
       "server" and (2) start the "browser".  This can be done in a
       variety of ways, but the two most common follow.

    <p><strong>Technique 1:</strong> issue the two commands:
      <pre>
        setenv SLUGS_START "open -a /Applications/Firefox.app ../SLUGS/Slugs.html"
        Slugs ../data/Slugs/tutorial1
      </pre>
      if using a c-shell; make appropriate changes for your shell
      and/or operating system.

    <p>The first of these tells <code>Slugs</code> to open FireFox on
       the file <code>../SLUGS/Slugs.html</code>
       when <code>Slugs</code> has generated a graphical
       representation of the configuration.  The second of these
       actually starts the <code>Slugs</code> server.  As long as the
       browser stays connected
       to <code>Slugs</code>, <code>Slugs</code> will stay alive and
       handle requests sent to it from the browser.  Once the last
       browser that is connected to <code>Slugs</code>
       exits, <code>Slugs</code> will shut down.

    <p><strong>Technique 2:</strong> issue the command:
       <pre>
         Slugs ../data/Slugs/tutorial1
       </pre>
       Once the server starts, start a browser (for example, FireFox)
       and open the page <code>SLUGS/Slugs.html</code>.  As
       above, <code>Slugs</code> will stay alive as long as there
       is a browser attached to it.

    <p>Note that the default "port" used by <code>Slugs</code> is
       7681.  One can change the port in the call
       to <code>Slugs</code> with a command such as:
       <pre>
         Slugs ../data/Slugs/tutorial1 -port 7788
       </pre>

    <p>Once the browser starts, you will be prompted for a
       "hostname:port" as in:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig01.png" width="800"/>

    <p>Most of the time, the "hostname" will be "Localhost" (meaning
       that <code>Slugs</code> and the browser are on the same
       computer).  It is possible to attach to <code>Slugs</code> that
       is running on another computer by giving an appropriate
       "hostname".

    <p>As mentioned above, it is possible to change the "port" with a
       command line argument when starting <code>Slugs</code>; if
       that is done, then the alternative "port" must be included in
      <code>Slugs</code>'s prompt.

    <p>Once all the setup is done, the browser then presents the
       following 4 windows:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig02.png" width="800"/>

    <p>The window on the top left is called the "Tree" window.  At the
       top of this window is a series of buttons.  Below that is a
       listing of the available commands.  It also contains the
       controls for the "Graphics" window.

    <p>The window on the top right is called the "Graphics" window,
       which contains a graphical representation of the current
       configuration, in three dimensions.

    <p>The window on the bottom left is the "Key" window.  It is
       currently blank and will be used in future versions.

    <p>The window on the bottom right is called the "Messages" window.
       It contains the messages that <code>Slugs</code> posts for the
       user.

    <p>The first thing to do is to play with the image in the
       "Graphics" window.  This is done with the mouse in the
       following ways:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drag</strong>: translate the graphical image</li>
        <li><strong>Shift-Drag</strong>: moving mouse up while
          dragging zooms in while moving the mouse down while dragging
          zooms out</li>
        <li><strong>Ctrl-Drag</strong>: rotate the object about its
          center (see below for more details)</li>
        <li><strong>Alt-Drag</strong>: rotate the view about an axis
          that is perpendicular to the screen.
          (Use <strong>Option-Drag</strong> on Mac OSX)</li>
      </ul>
      It is suggested that you use the left or middle mouse button for
      these operations, since in most browsers the right mouse button
      will post a popup menu.

    <p>When using the mouse, it is possible to enter "flying mode", in
       which the view continually changes until the mouse button is
       released.  Flying mode is particularly useful when one needs to
       translate a long distance.  Toggling flying mode is done by
       pressing the "<strong>!</strong>" key in the "Graphics" window.

    <p>At any time, a user might want to "save" a view for later use
       in the browser session.  This is done by pressing the
       "<strong>&gt;</strong>" key in the "Graphics" window; the
       "saved" view can be retrieved by pressing the
       "<strong>&lt;</strong>" key.

    <p>The default (home) view can be obtained by pressing either
       "<strong>&lt;Home&gt;</strong>",
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-h&gt;</strong>",
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-f&gt;</strong>", or the "<strong>H</strong>"
       button near the top of the "Tree" window.  (The home view is
       one in which the x-coordinate increases from left to right and
       the y-coordinate increases from bottom to top.)  One can also
       get the top view by pressing "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-t&gt;</strong>"
       or the "<strong>T</strong>" button, the bottom view by pressing
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-b&gt;</strong>" or the "<strong>B</strong>"
       button, the left side view by pressing
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-l&gt;</strong>" or the "<strong>L</strong>",
       or the right side view by pressing
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-r&gt;</strong>" or the "<strong>R</strong>"
       button.

    <p>The function of the arrow keys depends on whether "flying mode"
       is active or not.  For example, if "flying mode" is not active
       (the default), pressing the "<strong>&lt;Left&gt;</strong>" key
       causes the object to rotate to the left by 30 degrees; if
       "flying mode" is active (because the "<strong>!</strong>" key
       was pressed), then pressing the "<strong>&lt;Left&gt;</strong>"
       key causes the object on the screen to translate to the left.
       If the "<strong>Shift</strong>" is held while
       the "<strong>&lt;Left&gt;</strong>" key is pressed, the
       increments are 5 degrees and the translations are also smaller.

    <p>The "<strong>&lt;PgUp&gt;</strong>" or
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-i&gt;</strong>" keys or the
       "<strong>+</strong>" button can be used to zoom in and the
       "<strong>&lt;PgDn&gt;</strong>" or
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-o&gt;</strong>" key or the
       "<strong>-</strong>" button can be used to zoom out.  The
       behavior of these keys/buttons does not depend on the current
       "flying mode".

    <p>To re-center the image at a given point and simultaneously
       reset the point about which mouse rotations will occur, point
       to any location in the "Graphics" window and press
       "<strong>*</strong>"; the image will be re-centered and a
       message will be posted in the "Messages" window.

    <p>To determine the identity of any object in the "Graphics"
       window, simply put your cursor on the object and press
       "<strong>^</strong>"; a summary of the identified object is
       shown in the "Messages" window.  (Note that if the cursor is
       not exactly over any object, the message will only be posted
       once the mouse passes over a graphic object.)

    <p>To determine the approximate coordinates of any location in the
       "Graphics" window, simply put your cursor on the location and
       press "<strong>@</strong>"; the approximate coordinates of the
       location are shown in the "Messages" window.

    <p>Lastly, to get help on the commands that are available in the
       "Graphics" window, press "<strong>?</strong>" and a short
       listing will be given in the "Messages" window.

    <p>The results of several of these commands is shown in:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig03.png" width="800"/>

    <p>Now it is time to understand the "Tree" window. At the top of
      the "Tree" window there is a series of buttons:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Undo</strong> can be pressed to un-do the last
          operation; and </li>
        <li>"<strong>Help</strong>": this button opens up
            the <code>Slugs</code> HELP document (that you are now
            reading)</li>
        <li>"<strong>H</strong>": return to the home (front) view  ("x"
            right and "y" up)</li>
        <li>"<strong>L</strong>": left-side view ("z" right and "y"
            up)</li>
        <li>"<strong>R</strong>": right-side view ("z" left and "y"
            up)</li>
        <li>"<strong>B</strong>": bottom view ("x" right and "z"
            up)</li>
        <li>"<strong>T</strong>": top view ("x" right and "z"
            down)</li>
        <li>"<strong>+</strong>": zoom in</li>
        <li>"<strong>-</strong>": zoom out</li>
      </ul>
      One can verify the view with the little axes at the bottom-left
      corner of the "Graphics" window.  The red axis corresponds to
      "x", the green axis corresponds to "y", and the blue axis
      corresponds to "z".

    <p>Below the buttons is a tree-like representation of the various
       commands.  The tree can be collapsed; pressing the
       "<strong>+</strong>" at the beginning of any line expands
       (opens up) that particular entry in the tree; pressing the
       "<strong>-</strong>" at the beginning of any line collapses
       (closes) that particular entry.

    <p>Now look at the image in the "Graphics" window.  It consists of
      a series of triangles (from the <code>.stl</code> file).
      Triangle sides that are not shared by exactly two triangles are
      called "hanging sides" and are drawn with a red highlight.

    <p>As mentioned above, the hardest part of
      using <code>SLUGS</code> is deciding how to break the
      configuration into a combination of four-sided non-planar Faces
      and arbitrary planar Faces.  One such design for this case is
      shown in:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig04.png" width="800"/>
    <p>and
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig05.png" width="800"/>

    <p>The easiest thing to do first is to break the triangles into
      colors based upon "hard" sides, where a "hard" side is one whose
      dihedral angle exceeds a user-specified value.  In general, a
      value of 45 degrees successfully identifies sides that at which
      one would like to break the triangles into separate colors.  The
      user can execute this command by either pressing <code>Mark
      Creases</code> in the Tree window or by pressing the
      "<strong>m</strong>" key in the Graphics window; the user can
      always determine the keyboard shortcut for any command by
      looking at the blue entry in the Tree window.  When you have
      done this (with a minimum crease angle of <strong>45</strong>),
      links are created and are identified by white lines, as shown
      in:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig06.png" width="800"/>

    <p>It now makes sense to "color" the triangles in each of the
      regions bounded by these links.  So move the mouse over one of
      the triangles on the left end of the cylinder and press
      "<strong>c</strong>", which will give you the prompt:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig07.png" width="800"/>

    <p>The suggested value for the color is the next available color.
      (Note that the triangles in the original configuration all had
      color "0" and so the next available color is "1").  When you have
      done this, your screen should look like:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig08.png" width="800"/>

    <p>Continue to color the bottom of the triangular extrusion, the
      top of the extrusion, the right side of the extrusion, and the
      triangular tip of the extrusion.  Then color the right-hand end
      of the cylinder, giving:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig09.png" width="800"/>

    <p>The next step is to color the cylinder's surface.  Our design
      calls for the cylinder being broken into two halves.  If you
      rotate the cylinder a bit, you will see that the original
      triangles were created so as to have a series of triangle sides
      that form a nice straight line between the two cylinder halves.
      In order to create "links" to separate these, you will do a
      two-step operation:
      <ul>
        <li>Put your mouse over one end of these triangles sides and
          press "<strong>p</strong>" to select a point.  The selected
          point will be shown by a black square, as in:
          <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig10.png" width="800"/></li>
        <li>Put your mouse over another point and press the
          "<strong>l</strong>" key to select the triangle sides between
          the "<strong>p</strong>" and the "<strong>l</strong>", as
          in:
          <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig11.png" width="800"/>
          <p>Notice that this is not the intended path, so press
            the <string>Undo</strong> button.  Reset the "point" with
            the "<strong>p</strong>" key and now "link" to a new
            point, as shown in:
          <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig12.png" width="800"/>
          <p>Doing so advances the "point" to the last location
            chosen.  Now finish this operation (and the similar ones on
            the bottom of the cylinder).</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Now try to color the two sides of the cylinder.  This should
      give you something that looks like:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig13.png" width="800"/>

    <p>The only thing that we still need to worry about are the
      "floating triangles".  If you put your mouse over one of the
      triangles on the side of the cylinder that is closest to you and
      press "<strong>^</strong>", you will see in the message window
      that those triangles have the color "7".  To color the "floating
      triangles", put your mouse over one of them and press
      "<strong>c</strong>" and select color 7.

    <p>The next step is to break the cylinder side from which the
      protrusion grows into a series of 7 colors (so that each will be
      four-sided). This is done with a series of "scribe" operations.
      A "scribe" operation is similar to creating "links" above,
      except that the "scribe" breaks the triangles in a fairly
      straight line between the "point" and the scribe location.

    <p>Let's scribe the triangles in the region to the left of the
      sharp end of the protrusion.  This is done by selecting a point
      along the left end of the cylinder with the "<strong>p</strong>"
      command and then pressing "<strong>s</strong>" at the point at
      the junction of the cylinder and the sharp edge of the
      protrusion, as in:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig14.png" width="800"/>

    <p>Continue to "scribe" the cylinder as shown in:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig15.png" width="800"/>

    <p>After the whole cylindrical surface has been scribed, the
      various portions can be colored using the "<strong>c</strong>"
      command, giving:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig16.png" width="800"/>

    <p>Note that two different "colors" may appear to be the same due
      to the limited number of hues that <code>SLUGS</code> uses.  If
      you are not sure, use the "<strong>^</strong>" command to
      determine the actual color numbers.

    <p>The only thing remaining is to separate the back side of the
      cylinder into three colors so that each "color" will be bounded
      by four Edges.  Note that in "scribing" the back of the
      cylinder, it is generally good practice to make each scribe in
      two parts so that the "scribe" operation will operate on the
      back of the cylinder instead of on the front.  (Note: the "scribe"
      operation works by first finding the shortest path, as is done
      by the "<strong>l</strong>" command, and then straightening it.
      Since the two sides of the cylinder are roughly the same side,
      it is equally likely that the "scribe" operation will operate on
      the front of the cylinder as it is that it operate on the back;
      by doing the "scribe" in two parts, one can enforce it to
      operate on the back.)  The back of the cylinder looks like:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig17.png" width="800"/>

    <p>Note that all colors are either planar (the left and right
      cylinder ends as well as the "tip" of the extrusion), or are
      four-sided.  If you have done this correctly, you should now be
      able to select <strong>Generate EGADS</strong> in the Tree window
      or press the "<strong>E</strong>" key in the Graphics window.
      You will be prompted for the name of the <code>.egads</code>
      file; for the tutorial,
      use <code>../data/Slugs/tutorial1.egads</code>  You will then be
      prompted for the number of control points to use along each
      Edge. The more more control points that are used, the better the
      fit between the <code>.stl</code> and <code>.egads</code>
      representations.  But also, the more control points that are
      used, the higher liklihood that wiggles will be generated.
      Experience has shown that the optimal value to use is either "5"
      or "7".  Since there are not very many points in the cloud,
      choose "5" for this case.

    <p>If you have done everything successfully, you should get a
      screen such as:
    <p><img src="pictures/SLUGS-fig18.png" width="800"/>
    <p> and you will get a "success" message in the Messages window.

    <p>If you have a problem, the Messages window will inform you of what was
      found.  To isolate the problem, turn the Grid off on all Faces
      by pressing <strong>Grd</strong> to the right of "Triangles" in
      the Tree window and then pressing <strong>Grd</strong> to the
      right of the offending color.  Generally by looking at the
      offending color, one can determine if the color is four-sided or
      planar; if not, break the color into one or more colors and then
      generating the EGADS file again.

    <p>All reports of possible 'bugs' and any other feedback should be
       e-mailed to 'jfdannen@syr.edu' or 'Haimes@mit.edu'.  If a bug
       report, please include the version number you are running
       (listed in the title bar at the top of the program), what you
       were doing at the time of the bug, and what happened that you
       didn't expect.  The more information that you include, the
       better the chances that the bug can be reproduced and hence
       fixed.
