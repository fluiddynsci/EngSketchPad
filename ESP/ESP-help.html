    <p><h2 id="sec1">1.0: Overview</h2>

    <p>The Engineering Sketch Pad (<code>ESP</code>) is a
       browser-based program for creating, editing, and generating
       constructive solid models for use in the multi-disciplinary
       analysis and optimization of engineered systems.  It is built
       using a client-server architecture.

    <p>The server consists of a back-end program
       (<code>serveCSM</code>) that performs the majority of the
       computational work; the server has been designed to work on a
       variety of compute platforms, including UNIX, LINUX, OSX, and
       Windows.  As will be described below, the user
       of <code>ESP</code> typically starts a session by starting the
       server.

    <p>The client, which is built within a web browser, provides the
       graphical user interface with which most users will provide
       inputs and receive outputs.  The supported browsers include
       recent versions of FireFox, Google Chrome, and Safari.
       (Internet Explorer and Edge are not supported because of a bug
       within the WebSockets layer provided by the browser).

    <p><code>ESP</code> is technically just the user-interface to a
      system of software packages, including:
      <ul>
        <li><code>WebViewer</code> is a package for generating complex
            three-dimensional representations of geometry within a web
            Browser.  It consists of software that is incorporated
            into the server as well as a series of JavaScript
            functions that operate in the web Browser via
            <code>WebGL</code>.</li>
        <li><code>OpenCSM</code> is a feature-based, associative,
            parametric solid modeler that supports manifold solids
            (the typical output) and non-manifold sheets and wires
            (such as may be needed for representing wake sheets and
            antennae).  The inputs to <code>OpenCSM</code> is an
            ASCII, human-readable <code>.csm</code> file, in which
            the model is described by a series of design Parameters
            and a Feature Tree (or build prescription).  The Feature
            Tree consists of a user-specified series of standard
            primitives, Boolean operators, and transformations.
            <code>OpenCSM</code> also includes the ability for users
            to define their own user-defined primitives (via compiled
            code) and user-defined components (via scripts).  The
            persistence of Attributes, even through regenerations,
            directly supports the use of <code>OpenCSM</code> within
            multi-fidelity and multi-disciplinary analysis and
            design. <code>OpenCSM</code> also provides the ability
            for a user to compute the sensitivity of a configuration
            with respect to (any combination of) the design
            Parameters, often without regeneration; these
            sensitivities can then be used by a grid-generator so that
            the sensitivity of the grid with respect to the design
            Parameters can be computed.</li>
        <li><code>EGADS</code>, the Electronic Geometry Aircraft
            Design System, is an open-source geometry interface
            to <code>OpenCASCADE</code>, in which the functionality
            in <code>OpenCASCADE</code> that is needed for
            construction of typical applications is incorporated into
            about 70 C-functions.  These functions support a "bottom
            up" approach to configuration construction, in which the
            boundary representation (BRep) is built up from nodes, to
            curves, to edges, to loops, to surfaces, to faces, to
            shells, to bodies.  <code>EGADS</code> also supports a
            "top-down" approach, which directly maps
            to <code>OpenCSM</code>'s Feature
            Tree.  <code>EGADS</code> provides persistent user-defined
            Attributes on all topological entities.</li>
        <li><code>OpenCASCADE</code> is a large, openly-available
            geometry engine on which the rest of the system is
            built.  <code>OpenCASCADE</code> is the only part of
            the <code>ESP</code> system that needs to be acquired from
            an outside source.  See the <code>README.txt</code> file
            associated with the <code>ESP</code> distribution for
            details.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>All the parts of the <code>ESP</code> system are distributed as
       source code that is licensed via the LGPL 2.1 license.  See
       the <a href="#sec11">Copyright</a> section below for details.

    <p>In most cases, a user will start with a configuration that is
       described in a <code>.csm</code> file and then modify it and/or
       build it via <code>OpenCSM</code>'s various commands.

    <p>For a convenient Quick Reference,
       see <code>$ESP_ROOT/doc/ESP_QuickReference.pdf</code>, which is
       a two-page summary of the various <code>.csm</code> commands,
       built-in functions, dot-suffixes, the <code>ESP</code>
       character set, and a brief summary of the meanings of the various
       keypresses in <code>ESP</code>.

    <p><h3 id="sec1.1">1.1 Gallery of cases</h3>

    <p><code>ESP</code> ships with a assortment of
       <code>.csm</code> files, as shown below. Feel free to open them
       in your favorite text editor to see how they were constructed.

    <p><h2 id="sec2">2.0: Tutorials</h2>

    <p>The following tutorials have been designed to walk a
       new <code>ESP</code> user through the basic capabilities that
       are available through the user interface.  The tutorials have
       been designed to be executed in order, since latter tutorials
       assume that the user knows how to perform certain actions that
       were learned in an earlier tutorial. Additional information and
       examples can be found in the training section of the
       <code>ESP</code> distribution.

    <p>Users of <code>ESP</code> who do not plan on using the user
       interface are still encouraged to execute the tutorials, since
       many of the ideas used within <code>OpenCSM</code> (the
       underlying constructive solid modeler) are described in the
       tutorials.

    <p><h3 id="sec2.1">2.1 First tutorial: Basic usage</h3>

    <p>This tutorial will help you understand the use of
       <code>serveCSM</code> and <code>ESP</code> for a variety of
       tasks.  Details about the <a href="#sec3">Command
       Line</a>, <a href="#sec4">cursor and keyboard options</a>, and
       the <a href="#sec6">Example <code>.csm</code> file</a> are
       contained in sections that follow this tutorial.

    <p>The tutorial starts with a pre-made part that is defined by the
       file <code>tutorial1.csm</code>.  (See <a href="#sec6">
       Example <code>.csm</code> file</a> below for a listing of this
       file.)

    <p>To start <code>ESP</code> there are two steps: (1) start the
       "server" and (2) start the "browser".  This can be done in a
       variety of ways, but the two most common follow.

    <p><strong>Technique 1:</strong> issue the two commands:
      <pre>
        setenv ESP_START "open -a /Applications/Firefox.app ../ESP/ESP.html"
        serveCSM ../data/tutorial1
      </pre>
      if using a c-shell; make appropriate changes for your shell
      and/or operating system.

    <p>The first of these tells <code>serveCSM</code> to open FireFox
       on the file <code>../ESP/ESP.html</code>
       when <code>serveCSM</code> has generated a graphical
       representation of the configuration.  The second of these
       actually starts the <code>serveCSM</code> server.  As long as
       the browser stays connected
       to <code>serveCSM</code>, <code>serveCSM</code> will stay alive
       and handle requests sent to it from the browser.  Once the last
       browser that is connected to <code>serveCSM</code>
       exits, <code>serveCSM</code> will shut down.

    <p><strong>Technique 2:</strong> issue the command:
       <pre>
         serveCSM ../data/tutorial1
       </pre>
       Once the server starts, start a browser (for example, FireFox)
       and open the page <code>ESP/ESP.html</code>.  As
       above, <code>serveCSM</code> will stay alive as long as there
       is a browser attached to it.

    <p>Note that the default "port" used by <code>serveCSM</code> is
       7681.  One can change the port in the call
       to <code>serveCSM</code> with a command such as:
       <pre>
         serveCSM ../data/tutorial1 -port 7788
       </pre>

    <p>Once the browser starts, you will be prompted for a
       "hostname:port" as in:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig01.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Most of the time, the "hostname" will be "Localhost" (meaning
       that <code>serveCSM</code> and the browser are on the same
       computer).  It is possible to attach to <code>serveCSM</code>
       that is running on another computer by giving an appropriate
       "hostname".

    <p>As mentioned above, it is possible to change the "port" with a
       command line argument when starting <code>serveCSM</code>; if
       that is done, then the alternative "port" must be included in
      <code>ESP</code>'s prompt.

    <p>Once all the setup is done, the browser then presents the
       following 4 windows:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig02.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>The window on the top left is called the "Tree" window.  At the
       top of this window is a series of buttons.  Below that is a
       scrollable tree-like listing of the Parameters and Branches in
       the Model.  It also contains the controls for the "Graphics"
       window.

    <p>The window on the top right is called the "Graphics" window,
       which contains one of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>a graphical representation of the current configuration,
            in three dimensions;</li>
        <li>a 2D Sketcher; or</li>
        <li>a form (such as when adding or editing a Branch); when a
            form is present, you must press "<strong>Cancel</strong>"
            or "<strong>OK</strong>" in the form to return to the
            graphical representation.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>The window on the bottom left is the "Key" window.  Like the
       "Graphics" window, its contents will be one of:
      <ul>
        <li>the <code>ESP</code> logo;</li>
        <li>an annotated spectrum (that describes the mapping between
            sensitivity values and colors in the "Graphics" window);
            or</li>
        <li>the status of the Sketcher and a listing of the available
            Sketcher commands</li>
      </ul>

    <p>The window on the bottom right is called the "Messages" window.
       It contains the messages that <code>ESP</code> posts for the
       user.

    <p>The first thing to do is to play with the image in the
       "Graphics" window.  This is done with the mouse in the
       following ways:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drag</strong>: translate the graphical image</li>
        <li><strong>Shift-Drag</strong>: moving mouse up while
          dragging zooms in while moving the mouse down while dragging
          zooms out.  Note that the mouse wheel can also be used to
          zoom in and out.</li>
        <li><strong>Ctrl-Drag</strong>: rotate the object about its
          center (see below for more details)</li>
        <li><strong>Alt-Drag</strong>: rotate the view about an axis
          that is perpendicular to the screen.
          (Use <strong>Option-Drag</strong> on Mac OSX)</li>
      </ul>
      It is suggested that you use the left or middle mouse button for
      these operations, since in most browsers the right mouse button
      will post a popup menu.

    <p>When using the mouse, it is possible to enter "flying mode", in
       which the view continually changes until the mouse button is
       released.  Flying mode is particularly useful when one needs to
       translate a long distance.  Toggling flying mode is done by
       pressing the "<strong>!</strong>" key in the "Graphics" window.

    <p>At any time, a user might want to "save" a view for later use
       in the browser session.  This is done by pressing the
       "<strong>&gt;</strong>" key in the "Graphics" window; the
       "saved" view can be retrieved by pressing the
       "<strong>&lt;</strong>" key.

    <p>You can also save a view into a file with the
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-&lt;&gt;</strong>" or "<strong>,</strong>"
       keys, which will prompt you for a filename.  You can read a
       view file with the "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-&gt&gt</strong>" or
       "<strong>.</strong>" keys, which will prompt you for the view
       filename.  If the file does not exist, nothing will happen.

    <p>The default (home) view can be obtained by pressing either
       "<strong>&lt;Home&gt;</strong>",
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-h&gt;</strong>",
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-f&gt;</strong>", or the "<strong>H</strong>"
       button near the top of the "Tree" window.  (The home view is
       one in which the x-coordinate increases from left to right and
       the y-coordinate increases from bottom to top.)  One can also
       get the top view by pressing "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-t&gt;</strong>"
       or the "<strong>T</strong>" button, the bottom view by pressing
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-b&gt;</strong>" or the "<strong>B</strong>"
       button, the left side view by pressing
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-l&gt;</strong>" or the "<strong>L</strong>",
       or the right side view by pressing
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-r&gt;</strong>" or the "<strong>R</strong>"
       button.

    <p>The function of the arrow keys depends on whether "flying mode"
       is active or not.  For example, if "flying mode" is not active
       (the default), pressing the "<strong>&lt;Left&gt;</strong>" key
       causes the object to rotate to the left by 30 degrees; if
       "flying mode" is active (because the "<strong>!</strong>" key
       was pressed), then pressing the "<strong>&lt;Left&gt;</strong>"
       key causes the object on the screen to translate to the left.
       If the "<strong>Shift</strong>" is held while
       the "<strong>&lt;Left&gt;</strong>" key is pressed, the
       increments are 5 degrees and the translations are also smaller.

    <p>The "<strong>&lt;PgUp&gt;</strong>" or
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-i&gt;</strong>" keys or the
       "<strong>+</strong>" button can be used to zoom in and the
       "<strong>&lt;PgDn&gt;</strong>" or
       "<strong>&lt;Ctrl-o&gt;</strong>" key or the
       "<strong>-</strong>" button can be used to zoom out.  The
       behavior of these keys/buttons does not depend on the current
       "flying mode".

    <p>To re-center the image at a given point and simultaneously
       reset the point about which mouse rotations will occur, point
       to any location in the "Graphics" window and press
       "<strong>*</strong>" or "<strong>8</strong>"; the image will be
       recentered and a message will be posted in the "Messages"
       window.

    <p>To determine the identity of any object in the "Graphics"
       window, simply put your cursor on the object and press
       "<strong>^</strong>" or "<strong>6</strong>"; a summary of the
       identified object is shown in the "Messages" window.  (Note
       that if the cursor is not exactly over any object, the message
       will only be posted once the mouse passes over a graphic
       object.)

    <p>To determine the approximate coordinates of any location in the
       "Graphics" window, simply put your cursor on the location and
       press "<strong>@</strong>" or "<strong>2</strong>"; the
       approximate coordinates of the location are shown in the
       "Messages" window.

    <p>To add an Attribute to any Face or Edge, simply put your cursor
       on the object in the "Graphics" window and press
       "<strong>A</strong>" (upper case A). You will then be asked for
       the name of the new Attribute as well of its value, which can
       either be a string (if is starts with a $) or a semi-colon
       separated list of expressions.

    <p>Lastly, to get help on the commands that are available in the
       "Graphics" window, press "<strong>?</strong>" and a short
       listing will be given in the "Messages" window.

    <p>The results of several of these commands is shown in:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig03.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Now it is time to understand the "Tree" window.  When not in
       the Sketcher (the default), at the top of
       the "Tree" window is a series of buttons:
      <ul>
        <li>"<strong>File</strong>": this button pops up a menu that
        contains:
          <ul>
            <li>"<strong>New</strong>": this button removes the
              current Model (after prompting the user) and starts a
              new Model</li>
            <li>"<strong>Open</strong>": this button removes the
              current Model (after prompting the user) and opens the
              user-specified <code>.csm</code> file and builds its
              Model</li>
            <li>"<strong>Export FeatureTree</strong>": allows a user
              to save the current Feature Tree and Parameters into
              a <code>.csm</code> file.  Beware that using this option
              will over-write any file, causing you to lose any
              formatting or comments that may be in the original
              file</li>

            <li>"<strong>Edit</strong>": allows a user to edit the
              current <code>.csm</code> file</li>
            </ul>
            The <strong>File</strong> menu can be removed by
            re-pressing the "<strong>File</strong>" button.
        <li>"<strong>StepThru</strong>": this button enters StepThru
            mode (described below)</li>
        <li>"<strong>Help</strong>": this button opens up
            the <code>ESP</code> HELP document (that you are now
            reading)</li>
        <li>"<strong>Up to date</strong>": the meaning and text on this
            button will change (as described below)</li>
        <li>"<strong>Undo</strong>": allows a user to un-do any changes
            to the Model (as described below)</li>
        <li>"<strong>H</strong>": return to the home (front) view  ("x"
            right and "y" up)</li>
        <li>"<strong>L</strong>": left-side view ("z" right and "y"
            up)</li>
        <li>"<strong>R</strong>": right-side view ("z" left and "y"
            up)</li>
        <li>"<strong>B</strong>": bottom view ("x" right and "z"
            up)</li>
        <li>"<strong>T</strong>": top view ("x" right and "z"
            down)</li>
        <li>"<strong>+</strong>": zoom in</li>
        <li>"<strong>-</strong>": zoom out</li>
      </ul>
      One can verify the view with the little axes at the bottom-left
      corner of the "Graphics" window.  The red axis corresponds to
      "x", the green axis corresponds to "y", and the blue axis
      corresponds to "z".

    <p>Below the buttons is a tree-like representation of the "Design
       Parameters", "Local Variables", and "Branches" that describe
       the current Model.  In all cases, pressing the
       "<strong>+</strong>" at the beginning of any line expands
       (opens up) that particular entry in the tree; pressing the
       "<strong>-</strong>" at the beginning of any line collapses
       (closes) that particular entry.

    <p>Start off by pressing the "<strong>+</strong>" to the left of
       the words "Design Parameters".  When this is done, all the
       Design Parameters in the current Model are displayed as shown
       in:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig04.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Notice that the Design Parameter names are shown in green type;
       this indicates that the Parameter can be "edited" by the user;
       the Local Variable names are listed in black type and cannot be
       edited.

    <p>Now there are two ways to proceed.  The following paragraphs 
       describe the legacy method, using
       the <code>ESP</code> user interface.  This method is similar to
       other CAD systems, but experienced users find that using the
       integrated <code>.csm</code> editor to be much faster and
       easier to debug; it is described at the end of this tutorial.

    <p>Press on the label "Lbar" to edit the Parameter named "Lbar".
       When this is done, the user is provided with an editing form
       that asks for the new value; the current value is pre-loaded in
       this window, as in:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig05.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>For now change the value from "6" to "9" and  press the
       "<strong>OK</strong>" button or press the "<strong>Enter</strong>"
       key.  Note that the Parameter name is now listed in red (to
       indicate that it has been changed) and that the button at the
       top of the "Tree" window has changed to a green button that
       says "<strong>Press to Re-build</strong>".  This tells the user
       that changes have been made (to either a design Parameter or
       Feature Tree), but that the configuration shown in the
       "Graphics" window has not been updated.  (The reason this is
       done is that a user might want to make several changes to the
       "Model" before spending the CPU time necessary to re-build.)

    <p>Press the "<strong>Press to Re-build</strong>" button and
       notice that it first turns yellow while the configuration is
       being rebuilt.  Then (after a few seconds) the image in the
       "Graphics" window will be updated and the "Design Parameters"
       will no longer be red.

    <p>We will now change the value of "Lbar" back to "6".  (Do not
       re-build yet.)

    <p>Collapse the Parameters by pressing the "<strong>-</strong>" to
       the left of the word "Design Parameters" and expand the
       Branches by pressing the "<strong>+</strong>" to the left of
       the word "Branches".  This will result in a screen that looks
       like:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig06.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>There is an "Undo" button near the top of the "Tree" window.
       This button un-does your last change; an example of using this
       is shown later in this tutorial; for now, try not to use this
       button.

    <p>We are going to want to add a SPHERE to this configuration.
       Do this by pressing "<strong>Branches</strong>", giving you:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig07.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>The different types of Branches that can be added are listed in
       groups.  The groups at the top, which are labeled, generally
       construct or modify Bodys.  The Branches listed at the bottom
       are utilities, which generally effect the order in which the
       Branches are executed.  Those Branches marked with a star (*)
       are deprecated, meaning that they may be removed in future
       versions of ESP.

    <p>We will choose a SPHERE and press the "<strong>OK</strong>"
       button (or press the "<strong>Enter</strong>" key), giving us:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig08.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Now fill in the entries with "xcent" set to "1", "ycent" set to
       "0", "zcent" set to "0", and "radius" set to "2".  An easy way
       to cycle through the various entries is to press
       the "<strong>Tab</strong>" key. Press the "<strong>OK</strong>"
       button (or "<strong>Enter</strong>" key) and then "<strong>Press
       to Re-build</strong>" and you should see:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig09.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Now let's look at the "Display" part of the "Tree" window.  By
       default "Display" is expanded and you can see that you have two
       bodies named "Body 10" and "Body 9".  Expand the listing for
       Body 9 by pressing the "<strong>+</strong>" to the left of
       "Body 9" and you will see entries for Faces, Edges, Nodes, and
       Csystems.  To the right of "Faces" (below "Body 9") you will
       see three items:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Viz</strong>: toggles the visibility of all Faces
          associated with Body 9</li>
        <li><strong>Grd</strong>: toggles the grids associated with all
          the Faces in Body 9</li>
        <li><strong>Trn</strong>: toggles the pseudo-transparency of
          all the Faces associated with Body 9</li>
      </ul>
      Try each of these and see what happens.  (Notice that Body 9 is
      the original solid and Body 10 is the new sphere.)

      In addition, you can also change the display characteristics
      with key-presses in the Graphic window.  Hover over an entity
      and press:
      <ul>
        <li>"<strong>v</strong>" to toggle the visibility (Note that
          you will need to turn visibility on in the Tree Window since
          there is nothing to point to to turn it on in the Graphics
          Window.)</li>
        <li>"<strong>g</strong>" to toggle the grid</li>
        <li>"<strong>t</strong>" to toggle the transparency</li>
        <li>"<strong>o</strong>" to toggle the orientation</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Notice also that there is a "<strong>+</strong>" to the left of
       "Faces", which indicates that you can interact with the object
       on a Face-by-Face basis.  The basic rules here are:
      <ul>
        <li>changes made to a specific entity (such as a Face or Edge)
          applies only to that entity</li>
        <li>changes made to the heading (such as "Faces") applies
          to all Faces in the group</li>
        <li>changes made at the Body level applies to all Faces and
          Edges in the body</li>
      </ul>

    <p>When you have a configuration with lots of Bodys, it is
       sometimes useful to turn the visibility of all Faces, Edges, or
       Nodes (in all Bodys) on or off.  This can be done by pressing
       on the word "<strong>Display</strong>" in the Key Window.

    <p>Now let's combine the sphere and the original solid by adding a
       UNION Branch.  (Press "<strong>Branches</strong>" and add a
       UNION).  This operation wants to know if the operation should
       be applied to the top two Bodys on the stack (tomark=0) or to
       all the Bodys on the stack since the last mark (tomark=1).  For
       now, we want to use the default (tomark=0).  Also, we want an
       untrimmed union (the default), and so set (trimList=0).
       Lastly, we do not want to modify the tolerances associated with
       this operation, so use the default (maxtol=0).  Re-build the
       configuration and you should get the solid shown in:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig10.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Note that we now only have one body. (Body 11)

    <p>After some thought you realize that you really didn't want the
       union (or fusion) of these two volumes, but instead you wanted
       the solid that is common to them (that is, their intersection).
       First, remove the UNION; this can easily be done by clicking on
       "Brch_00012" and then choosing "Delete this Branch".
       (Alternatively you could press the "Undo" button at the top of
       the "Tree" window; but if you use "Undo" the Branch numbering
       will be slightly different, making it slightly more difficult
       to follow the directions in this tutorial.)

    <p>Now add the intersection by pressing
       "<strong>Branches</strong>" and then choosing INTERSECT.
       This operation wants to know what happens if more than one
       solid is produced by the operation.  Specifically, the "$order"
       argument describes how the bodies that are produced should be
       ordered: for example in order of volume, surface area, ...  The
       "index" argument tells which body in the list should be
       selected.  Since we are only expecting one body to be produced,
       we can leave the defaults.  Also, for now we do not want to
       modify the tolerances, so leave the default (maxtol=0) and then
       "<strong>Press to Re-build</strong>", producing:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig11.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>You notice that the "head" is too thin, and so you change the
       "radius" of the SPHERE to "2.3".  (Press "Brch_000011" and
       change the "radius".)  While you are at it, change the
       Parameter "Rbar" to "0.4" (you will need to expand the Design
       Parameters) and rebuild, producing:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig12.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Now we want to drill a hole through the center of the shaft;
       this is done by subtracting a cylinder from the solid.  Create
       a cylinder by selecting "<strong>Branches</strong>" and
       CYLINDER.  We want the hole to go the entire length of the
       configuration (which is centered and whose length is 2*L), and
       so we enter "-1.2*L" for "xbeg" and "+1.2*L" for "xend"; the
       "1.2" simply ensures that the cylinder extends beyond the end
       of the configuration.  Since it is on the centerline, set
       "ybeg", "zbeg", "ybeg", and "yend" all to "0", and finally the
       "radius" to "0.2".

    <p>Note that any argument can either be entered as a numeric
       constant or as an expression (using Matlab-like syntax),
       possibly using the name of a Design Parameter (such as "L") or
       a Local Variable.

    <p>To add the SUBTRACT Branch, we will click on
       "<strong>Branches</strong>" and then choose SUBTRACT, use the
       defaults and rebuild, producing:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig13.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>You can now proceed to the <a href="#sec2.1c">common part of
       the tutorial</a> or take a detour to explore the new
       integrated <code>.csm</code> editor (which is next).

    <p>Now we want to create a series (pattern) of small holes that
       are drilled across the shaft.  Start by creating a new
       Parameter (by clicking on "<strong>Design Parameters</strong>")
       and name it "Rhole".  The rules for names is that they must
       start with a letter and contain up to 32 letters, digits,
       colons, and underscores.  By default the new "<strong>Design
       Parameter</strong>" contains only one value (that is, it is a
       scalar).  (Aside: If one wants a row vector, a column vector,
       or a 2D matrix, press the "<strong>Add row</strong>" or
       "<strong>Add column</strong>" button before entering values in
       the table.)

    <p>Since we only want a scalar, just use the standard form, such
       as:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig14.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Set the (only) value to "0.08".  You can either press the
       "<strong>OK</strong>" button or press
       the "<strong>Enter</strong>" key to save this value.

    <p>Now we are going to add a pattern of holes.  Do this by adding
       a new PATBEG Branch; the "$pmtrName" will be "i" and the
       "ncopy" will be 7 (since we want 7 holes).  (The "$" at the
       beginning of "$pmtrName" says that this is the name of the
       Parameter that will be created rather than the value of the
       Parameter "i").  This will produce a warning in the Messages
       window that informs us that we do not yet have a matching
       PATEND statement yet.

    <p>Also add a CYLINDER with "xbeg" and "xend" set to "i/3", "ybeg"
       and "yend" set to "0", "zbeg" set to "-1", "zend" set to "+1",
       and "radius" set to "Rhole".  Press "<strong>OK</strong>" or
       "<strong>Enter</strong>".  Again you will get the warning
       telling you that you still do not have a matching PATEND.

    <p>We would now like to name this Branch.  To do this, edit the
       Branch (by pressing "Brch_000017") and change its "Name" to
       "small_holes".  (Notice that we could not name it when we
       created it since the names are originally auto-created to
       ensure that we do not get an illegal name.)

    <p>Next add another SUBTRACT Branch (with the default arguments)
       and finally a PATEND Branch and then re-build (which will take
       several seconds), giving:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig15.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Now we want to change the hole in the center of the shaft into
       a hole that starts at "xbeg" equal to "0".  Make the change to
       "Brch_000014" and re-build.  To see if you were successful,
       change the visibility of the faces and ensure that you have the
       correct hole, as in:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig16.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Now change the cylindrical hole into a conical hole.  To do
       this, we must delete the cylinder hole (which is Brch_000014).
       Click on "Brch_000014" and choose "Delete this Branch".  Notice
       that doing this warns you that the Branches are not properly
       nested.  To fix the error, add a conical hole after
       "Brch_000013" by clicking "Brch_000013" and choosing "Add new
       Branch after this Branch", as in:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig17.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Re-build and notice that the vertex of the cone is near the
       head; you will have to change the visibility of the Faces to
       see this.  We had meant to do it the other way, so change
       "xvrtx" to "0" and "xbase" to "1.2*L" and re-build, producing
       (after manipulating the display):
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig18.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>A new ESP feature is to visually step through the build
       process.  This is particularly useful when you want to
       understand the build process that was used in
       a <code>.csm </code> file that you acquired from another
       source.  To do this press the "<strong>StepThru</strong>"
       button and you should see:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig19.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>This is the result of executing the first Branch that created a
       Body. You can now press "<strong>NextStep</strong>" four times
       and you should see:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig20.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>You can either continue pressing the
       "<strong>NextStep</strong>" button (or press the
       "<strong>n</strong>" key in the Graphics window (for next))
       until you get to the end of the build, you can press the
       "<strong>p</strong>" key for previous, or you can press
       "<strong>Cancel StepThru</strong>" in the Tree Window to return
       to the normal viewing mode.

    <p>By now you probably have noticed that the Branches with a
       pattern (that is, between the PATBEG and PATEND) are hidden; to
       see these, press the <strong>+</strong> to the left
       of <strong>Brch_000016</strong>. Now let's rotate the small
       holes, so after the "small_holes" Branch, add a ROTATEX with
       arguments "-15*(i-1)", "0", and "0", and rebuild, producing:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig21.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Now we will experiment with the "activity" of the Branches.  A
       Branch that is "suppressed" is skipped during the re-build
       process. So click on "Brch_000021" (you will need to
       expand the listing of the pattern first) and change the
       "Activity" from "Active" to "Suppressed", and select
       "<strong>OK</strong>" or press "<strong>Enter</strong>".  When
       you rebuild, you should see:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig22.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Re-activate "Brch_000021" and re-build.

    <p>Another feature is <code>ESP</code> allows a user to only build
       part of the configuration.  This is done by clicking on a
       Branch (for example, "Brch_000010") and choosing "Build to this
       Branch", giving:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig23.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>To rebuild the whole configuration, either re-build to the last
       Branch by clicking it and choosing "Build to this Branch" or
       press the "Up to date" button (which will ask if you are sure
       before regenerating the configuration).

    <p>The next part of the <code>ESP</code> tutorial involves
       Attributes.  Each Branch can have zero or more Attributes
       associated with it that are carried throughout the build
       process.  Open the "Brch_000009" Branch for editing and press
       "<strong>Show Attributes/Csystems</strong>".  You will see that
       this Branch has an Attribute ("clipper") that has the value
       "1".  Change the Attribute to "10", and
       press <strong>OK</strong>.

    <p>We can add an Attribute to "Brch_000009" by editing it,
       pressing "<strong>Show Attributes/Csystems</strong>", and then
       "<strong>Add Attribute/Csystem</strong>".  The first choice is
       whether we want to add an Attribute or a Csystem; we want to
       enter "1"; we will use the name "test" and the value "ESP".
       After some thought, you realize that "ESP" is not defined (that
       is, does not have a value), so you can "undo" this change by
       pressing the "Undo" button at the top of the "Tree" window.
       Re-build.

    <p>Now point to the face that represents the corner of the head
       (as shown with its grid here) and press the
       "<strong>^</strong>" or "<strong>6</strong>" key, producing:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig24.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>(Depending on the version of OpenCASCADE that you are using,
       the face number that is returned may be different.)

    <p>Note that the "Messages" window contains a description of the
       face including the Attribute that we edited ("clipper" is "10")
       as well as a "_body" and "_brch" Attribute.  The latter tells
       which Branch ("Brch_000009") was responsible for generating
       that face.

    <p>You can also add Attributes graphically.  Point to the same
       Face and press the "<strong>A</strong>" key.  When prompted for
       an Attribute name, enter "partID", and when prompted for the
       Attribute value, enter the semicolon-separated list
       "1;2;sqrt(3)".  (Alternatively, you could have entered
       "$1;2;sqrt(3)" to add that string value, as signified by the
       leading dollar sign ($)). Rebuild.  Then press
       the "<strong>^</strong>" key to verify that the Face has your
       new Attribute.

    <p>A unique feature of ESP is that it allows a user to compute the
       sensitivity of the configuration with respect to any
       perturbation in the specified Parameters.  Most often this is
       done by clicking on a the name of one of the Design Parameters
       and selecting "<strong>Compute Sensitivity</strong>".

    <p>For the current case, expand the Parameters list (in the Tree
       window) and click on "Rbar" and select "<strong>Compute
       Sensitivity</strong>".  ESP notes this by putting a caret
       before the "Rbar" and then will automatically compute the
       sensitivity and display, in the Graphics window, an updated
       configuration that is colored based upon the change in the
       local surface normal; positive sensitivity indicates that the
       surface will tend to move in the direction of the outward
       normal.  The Key window will show the meanings of the various
       colors and will be titled "d(norm)/d(Rbar)", as in:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig25.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>To change the limits of the color spectrum, left click in the
       Key window and you will be prompted for the minimum value
       (associated with blue) and the maximum value (associated with
       red). Try clicking on the Key window and set the limits to
       "-0.5" and "+0.5" and see how the display changes.

    <p>Now ask for the sensitivity with respect to "D" (click on "D"
       and select "<strong>Compute Sensitivity</strong>") and again
       the display will automatically update.

    <p>Occasionally one wants to know the change in the configuration
       based upon the perturbation of more than one Parameter (at the
       same time).  To do this, first click on "Rbar" and clear all
       the Design Velocities by clicking on "<strong>Clear Design
       Velocities</strong>", and then "<strong>Set Design
       Velocity</strong>" to 1; then click on "Rhole" and "<strong>Set
       Design Velocity</strong>" to 1.5.  Now manually re-build the
       configuration (since you may want to set the Design Velocity
       for multiple Parameters before rebuilding).  Note that the
       legend in the Key window will now be "d(norm)/d(***)",
       indicating that there was either more than one Design Parameter
       for which the Design Velocity was set (see that Rbar and Rhole
       both are pre-pended with a caret to indicate this), or there is
       one Parameter whose Design Velocity is not unity (and hence the
       color does not show sensitivity but rather a scaled
       sensitivity.)

    <p>Save your work by pressing the "<strong>File</strong>" button,
       then the "<strong>ExportFeatureTree</strong>" button, and
       finally entering "tutorial1_new.csm" as the name of the new
       file.

    <p>Now explore the <strong>.csm</strong> editor.  Choose
       "<strong>File</strong>" button, then the
       "<strong>Edit</strong>" button.  The version of your file will
       be displayed.  The buttons across the top perform various
       editing tasks.
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig26.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>The integrated editor has a row of buttons at the top:
      <ul>
        <li>"<strong>Copy</strong>": take highlighted text and puts a
          copy of it into the clipboard
        <li>"<strong>Cut</strong>": remove highlighted text and put it
          into the clipboard
        <li>"<strong>Paste</strong>": put copy of the clipboard at the
          current cursor location
        <li>"<strong>Search</strong>": look for a string (see prompt
          near top of screen). The search is case sensitive.
        <li>"<strong>Prev</strong>": look for previous occurrence of
          current search string
        <li>"<strong>Next</strong>": look for next occurence of
          current search string
        <li>"<strong>Replace</strong>": replace current search string
          with the replacement text (see prompt near top of screen)
        <li>"<strong>Comment</strong>": for the current highlighted
        text
          <ul>
            <li>if the first line is uncommented, comment all lines that
              are highlighted
            <li>if the first line is commented, uncomment all lines
              that are highlighted (if possible)
          </ul>
        <li>"<strong>Indent</strong>": use standard indentation for
          all highlight lines
        <li>"<strong>Hint</strong>": provide a hint of the arguments
          associated with the line at the current cursor (see top of
          screen for hint)
        <li>"<strong>Undo</strong>": undo the last change
        <li>"<strong>Cancel</strong>": exit the editor and do not save
          changes
        <li>"<strong>Save</strong>": save the changes and exit the
        editor
          <ul>
            <li>if editing the <code>.csm</code> file and there are no
              current <code>.udc</code> files, then the configuration
              is automatically rebuilt
            <li>otherwise, you will need to press "<strong>Press to
                Rebuild</strong>" to rebuild the configuration
          </ul>
      </ul>

    <p>Note that the text in the file is colored:
      <ul>
        <li>comments are show in <strong>grey</strong>
        <li>command names are shown in <strong>blue</strong> (this is
          an easy way to check that you have spelled the command name
          correctly)
        <li>parameter names are shown in <strong>yellow</strong>
        <li>numbers are shown in <strong>green</strong>
        <li>strings are shown in <strong>magenta</strong>
        <li>quotation marks (which show the extent of an argument) are
          shown in <strong>cyan</strong>
      </ul>

    <p>Start by highlighting lines 12 and 13 and then press the
       "<strong>Copy</strong>" button.  You can then move your  cursor
       to the beginning of line 14 and press "<strong>Paste</strong>",
       which will insert the copied text.  Highlight lines 14 and 15
       and press "<strong>Cut</strong>" to remove the text you just
       added.

    <p>Place your cursor on somewhere on line 1 and press the
       "<strong>Search</strong>" button.  At the top, enter "Rbar" and
       press <strong>Enter</strong>.  You can press
       "<strong>Next</strong>" and "<strong>Prev</strong>" to go to
       the next and previous occurrences.  You can replace text using
       the "<strong>Replace</strong>" button.

    <p>You can provide block-comments.  Highlight lines 42 through 44
       and press the "<strong>Comment</strong>" button to add a
       block-comment.  If you now highlight line 43 and press
       "<strong>Comment</strong>" again, you will see that line 43 was
       uncommented (since the first highlighted line contains a
       block-comment). Remove the whole block-comment by highlighting
       lines 42 through 44 and pressing "<strong>Comment</strong>"
       again.

    <p>The "<strong>Hint</strong>" button gives you a hint on the
       current command.  For example, pressing the button with the
       cursor somewhere on line 29 show the hint for the CYLINDER
       command at the top of the editor window.

    <p>Finally exit the browser and you should see
       that <code>serveCSM</code> also shuts down.

    <p>If we now rename the file journal file (which was automatically
       generated while you were running ESP) with:
      <pre>
        mv port7681.jrnl tutorial1.jrnl
      </pre>
      we can replay our session by the command:
      <pre>
        serveCSM ../data/tutorial1 -jrnl tutorial1.jrnl
      </pre>
      This replays all your operations, so it may take a while to
      execute.

    <p>Alternatively, we can start with the new
      <code>tutorial1_new.csm</code> file (which we just created
      above) with the command:
      <pre>
        serveCSM tutorial1_new
      </pre>
      This will run more quickly since it simply executes the final
      Feature Tree (of Branches).

    <p>This tutorial covered most of <code>ESP</code>'s user
       interface.  Further details are contained in the sections that
       follow.

    <p>Now we will learn how to develop a configuration using the
       integrated editor.  Make a copy of the
       original <code>.csm</code> file and
       restart <code>serveCSM</code>.
      <pre>
       cp       ../data/tutorial1.csm ../data/tutorial1_temp.csm
       serveCSM ../data/tutorial1_temp
      </pre>
      or
      <pre>
       copy     ..\data\tutorial1.csm ..\data\tutorial1_temp.csm
       serveCSM ..\data\tutorial1_temp
      </pre>

    <p>Start by pressing the "<strong>File</strong>" button and then
       "<strong>Edit: ../data/tutorial1_temp.csm</strong>".  This will
       display the contents of the (original) tutorial file in code
       form. Notice at the top you have Design Parameters with their
       given values which are followed by the Branches and their
       arguments.

    <p>Start by finding the Design Parameter "Lbar", shown in the line
       "<code>despmtr Lbar 6.00</code>" on your screen. You can edit
       this parameter by simply changing the number. Do this now,
       change the "6.00" to "9.00" and then press
       "<strong>Save</strong>". This will change the length of the bar
       and automatically rebuild the model.

    <p>Return to "<strong>Edit</strong>" and change the value of
       “Lbar” back to “6.00”, but do not save yet. We will now add a
       SPHERE branch to the model. To do this, add a line under the
       "intersect" corresponding to "clip weights with outer cylinder"
       that reads "SPHERE".  This branch needs four arguments, which
       are "xcent", "ycent", "zcent" and "radius". If you would like
       to see for yourself, put your cursor somewhere in the word
       "SPHERE" and then press the "<strong>Hint</strong>" button at
       the top of the screen. This button will tell you the required
       arguments for any branch you add. Now set these arguments as
       "xcent" set to "1", "ycent" set to "0", "zcent" set to "0", and
       "radius" set to "2"; in other words, add the line "<code>SPHERE
       1 0 0 2</code>" and press "<strong>Save</strong>".

    <p>Now try to combine the sphere and the original solid by adding
       a "UNION" Branch under the line that starts with
       "SPHERE". Re-build by saving the edits. Notice that this is not
       the shape we wanted. To fix this replace the "UNION" Branch
       with an "INTERSECT" Branch and save again.

    <p>Now you can see that the head of our shape is too thin, so
       increase the radius of the sphere from "2" to "2.3", and while
       you are at it change the design parameter "Rbar" to "0.4".

    <p>The next step is to create a hole through the center of the
       shaft. To do this we will create a CYLINDER and then SUBTRACT
       it from the solid. Create a new "CYLINDER" Branch with
       the arguments "-1.2*L" and "+1.2*L" for "xbeg" and "xend"
       respectively, as well as "0" for "ybeg", "zbeg", "yend", and
       "zend". Finally, set "radius" to "0.2".  Remove the material in
       this new
       cylinder from the existing solid by adding a "SUBTRACT" Branch under the
       new "CYLINDER" line.  In other words, add the lines
      <pre>
       CYLINDER  -1.2*L  0.0  0.0  +1.2*L  0.0  0.0  0.2
       SUBTRACT
      </pre>
       and "<strong>Save</strong>".

    <p>As you can see, the ideas are the same as using
       the <code>ESP</code> Tree Window, but experienced users find it
       much faster using the integrated editor.

    <p><h3 id="sec2.2">2.2 Second tutorial: Sketcher</h3>

    <p>For the second tutorial, we will start <code>serveCSM</code>
       without a <code>.csm</code> file and investigate the use of the
       Sketcher.

    <p>Start <code>ESP</code> by issuing the command:
      <pre>
        serveCSM
      </pre>

    <p>If you have not set the <code>ESP_START</code> environment
       variable, you will have to open a browser on a file
       named <code>../ESP/ESP.html</code> and select the default
       hostname and port (Localhost:7681).  A blank
       <code>ESP</code> should open up for you.

    <p>We are going to start with an empty sketch.  To do this we will
       first add a SKBEG Branch by pressing
       "<strong>Branches</strong>", selecting a SKBEG, and making
       the "x", "y", and "z" all zero.  The final
       argument, <code>relative</code>, is set to 1 to indicate that
       all coordinates in the sketch are relative to the coordinates
       that were contained in the SKBEG statement.

    <p>When a SKBEG Branch is added, ESP now automatically adds the
       matching SKEND Branch and automatically enters the Sketcher.

    <p>There are several changes between normal 3D mode and the
       Sketcher.  The first difference are the buttons on the top of
       the "Tree" window.  A second button has now appeared that is
       labeled "<strong>Sketch</strong>", which will pop up a menu
       with the entries:
      <ul>
        <li>"<strong>Save</strong>": this will save the current Sketch
          and exit the Sketcher</li>
        <li>"<strong>Quit</strong>": this will exit the Sketcher (with
          all the work done in the Sketcher being lost)</li>
      </ul>

    <p>The legend on another button has now changed to
       "<strong>Drawing...</strong>", which describes the status of
       the Sketcher.

    <p>Also, the "Key" window now lists the Sketcher's status, in
       terms of the number of degrees of freedom (<code>ndof</code>)
       and the number of constraints (<code>ncon</code>).  This is
       followed by a listing of the available commands in the
       Sketcher.

    <p>Within the Sketcher (which is displayed in the "Graphics"
       window), there is a point at the center that has the legend
       "XY" and a blue line between that point and the current cursor
       location.  As you move the cursor around in the Sketcher, you
       will notice that the blue line follows the cursor.  You will
       also notice that if the line is approximately horizontal or
       vertical, it will change from blue to orange; this is an
       indication that if the current cursor location is chosen (see
       below), an implicit "horizontal" or "vertical" constraint will
       be created.

    <p>As you can see in the "Key" window, you have 6 choices:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>l</strong> - create a line segment (LINSEG) in the
          sketch</li>
        <li><strong>c</strong> - create a circular arc (ARC) in the
          sketch</li>
        <li><strong>s</strong> - add a spline point (SPLINE) to the
          sketch</li>
        <li><strong>b</strong> - add a Bezier control point (BEZIER)
          to the sketch</li>
        <li><strong>z</strong> - add a zero-length segment</li>
        <li><strong>o</strong> - finish the sketch (that is, leave a
          sketch open)</li>
      </ul>

    <p>If you just press the mouse button, the "<strong>l</strong>"
       option will be chosen for you.  So now, draw the sketch shown
       in:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig27.png" width="100%"/>
    <p>in a counter-clockwise direction, starting at the point with
       the label "XY".  Make sure that when you have completed the
       closed sketch, the last point should be the same as the first
       point.  You can ensure this by noting that a circle is placed
       around the first point if the last point is "close enough".

    <p>Notice that several of the line segments have either the letter
       "H" or "V" associated with them.  These "horizontal" or
       "vertical" constraints were automatically added for you since
       you pressed "<strong>l</strong>" or the mouse button when the
       line was orange.  Also notice that since you "closed" the
       sketch, it got filled in with grey.  (If you had left it open
       by pressing the "o" key, there would be no filling.)

    <p>Your completed sketch should now have 16 degrees of freedom
       (since there are 8 points and no arcs) and 10 constraints.  To
       see what the meaning of the various constraint letters are,
       notice that the "Key" window has now changed to explain the
       meaning of the constraints.  In summary, at the first point,
       both the "x" and "y" coordinates are fixed.  The other
       constraints are that certain line segments are either
       constrained to be horizontal (H) or vertical(V).

    <p>Since the number of constraints is fewer than the number of
       degrees of freedom, we will have to add more constraints.

    <p>If you do not know what constraint(s) to add, press the
       "<strong>Constraining...</strong>" button and several choices
       will be presented to you (in green), as in:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig28.png" width="100%"/>
    <p>We will choose the following:
      <ul>
        <li>put the cursor over the middle of the bottom segment and
          press "<strong>L</strong>" (which will set its length) and
          enter "4" in the pop-up</li>
        <li>put the cursor over the left vertical line, press
          "<strong>L</strong>" and enter "3"</li>
        <li>put the cursor over the right vertical line, press
          "<strong>L</strong>" and enter "3"</li>
        <li>put the cursor over the horizontal segment at the
          top-left, press "<strong>L</strong>", and enter "1"</li>
        <li>put the cursor over the horizontal segment at the
          top-right, press "<strong>L</strong>", and enter "1"</li>
        <li>put the cursor over the vertical segment on the left side
          of the slot, press "<strong>L</strong>", and enter "2"</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Since the number of constraints matches the number of degrees
       of freedom, the grey fill has changed to a light green fill and
       the first button has turned green with the legend
       "<strong>Press to Solve</strong>".  Press that button and
       (hopefully) your sketch will solve.  (If it does not, you can
       always remove constraints by moving the cursor over the
       constraint and pressing "<", which deletes selected constraints
       at that point or on that segment.)  To center the image, either
       press <Ctrl-H> or press the "<strong>H</strong>" button.  You
       screen should look like:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig29.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>We are now finished with the Sketcher (for now), so press
       "<strong>Sketch</strong>" and then "<strong>Save</strong>" to
       return to the normal 3D view.  You can now press "<strong>Press
       to Re-build</strong>" to rebuild the 3D object, giving a screen
       that looks like:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig30.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>You will notice that we hard-coded dimensions into our sketch.
       To make the sketch more useful, it would be convenient to drive
       it with Design Parameters.  To do this, we first have to create
       them.  This is done (as in tutorial 1) by pressing
       "<strong>Design Parameters</strong>" in the "Tree" window,
       entering "length" as the Parameter name and setting its value
       to "4".

    <p>In a similar way, create a "height" Design Parameter whose
       value is "3" and a "thick" Design Parameter whose value is
       "0.5".

    <p>Now, let's use these Design Parameters in the sketch.  To do
       this, choose one of the statements between the SKBEG and
       SKEND.  I suggest choosing "Branch_00003", which is the
       SKVAR statement (which shows the default locations of each of
       the sketch points).  Select "<strong>Enter Sketcher</strong>".

    <p>We are now going to change the various "L" constraints, by
       moving the mouse over the "L", pressing "<strong>L</strong>"
       and entering the new value.  Specifically, you should change
       the "L" constrains as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>bottom should have length set to "length"</li>
        <li>left should have its length set to "height"</li>
        <li>right should have its length set to "height"</li>
        <li>top-left should have its length set  to "thick"</li>
        <li>top-right should have its length set  to "thick"</li>
        <li>left side of slot should have its length set to
          "height-thick"</li>
      </ul>

    <p>"<strong>Sketch</strong>" and "<strong>Save</strong>" (to exit
      the Sketcher) and "<strong>Press to Re-build</strong>" to use
      the latest changes.

    <p>Think about what we have done.  We have made a U-shaped channel
       whose overall length and height were given, and whose channel
       walls were all set to "thick".  Suppose instead that the
       "design intent" of the channel was to create a channel of a
       given slot width.  In this case, we would want to constrain the
       sketch differently.

    <p>Start by creating a Design Parameter named "slot" whose single
       value was "1".  Now select "Branch_000002" and "<strong>Enter
       Sketcher</strong>".  We are going to have to remove the "L"
       constraints from the top two horizontal segments, so go to each
       and press "<strong>&lt;</strong>".  Since there are two
       constraints here, you are asked which constraint to remove.
       Simply enter "L" at the prompt and the length constraint will
       be removed by the horizontal constraint will remain.  If you
       want to remove all constraints, press "<strong>&lt;</strong>"
       multiple times.

    <p>Now move the mouse over the horizontal segment at the bottom of
       the slot and press "<strong>L</strong>" and set the length to
       "slot".  You will notice that the sketch is under-constrained
       (is grey).  We need to add a constraint that the slot is
       centered.  To do this, we are going to make the lengths of the
       two small horizontal segments near the top on each side of the
       U equal to each other.  The first step here is to identify one
       of the segments.  This is done with the "<strong>?</strong>"
       command.  So, move the cursor over the top-left horizontal
       segment and press "?".  You will notice in the "Messages"
       window that this is segment 7.  Now move over the top-right
       horizontal segment and enter the length "::L[7]", which tells
       it to use the same length as segment 7.  "<strong>Press to
       Solve</strong>" to give:

    <p>"<strong>Sketch</strong>" and "<strong>Save</strong>" and
       "<strong>Press to Re-build</strong>".

    <p>Now open the list of Design Parameters (using the
       "<strong>+</strong>" to the left of "Design Parameters") and
       change the value of "slot" to "2".  "<strong>Press to
       Re-build</strong>" to see the effect of this change.

    <p>We will now experiment with some of the other constraints.
       Specifically we will be removing some of our "H" and "V"
       constraints and instead add constraints at some of the points.
       Re-enter the Sketcher and move the cursor over the right-hand
       segment, press "<strong>&lt;</strong>" to remove the vertical
       constraint.  Similarly remove the horizontal constraint from
       the top-right horizontal segment.

    <p>The sketch is under-constrained (is grey).  We are going to add
       a perpendicularity constraint at the point at the lower-right
       corner by moving the mouse over the point and pressing
       "<strong>P</strong>".  Just to be different, at the top-right
       point we are going to add an "angle" constraint by pressing
       "<strong>A</strong>" and adding a value of "90".

    <p>"<strong>Press to Solve</strong>" and "<strong>Sketch</strong>"
       and "<strong>Save</strong>".

    <p>We are now going to extrude the sketch into a solid.  This is
       done by first creating a Design Parameter named "depth" and
       giving it a default value of "3".  Then add an EXTRUDE
       Branch, whose arguments are "dx"="0", "dy"="0", and
       "dz"="depth".  This will extrude the sketch in the "z"
       direction (out of the screen).  "<strong>Press to
       Re-build</strong>", yielding:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig33.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>As with most programs, it makes sense to periodically save your
       work, so press "<strong>File</strong>", "<strong>Export
       FeatureTree</strong>", and save the current model in a file
       named "<code>../data/tutorial2</code>".  (Note that the
       "<code>.csm</code>" suffix will automatically be added for
       you.)

    <p>To see the <code>.csm</code> file associated with the current
       model, press the "<strong>File</strong>" and
       "<strong>Edit</strong>" buttons.  At the top of the file, all
       the Design Parameters are defined (along with their current
       values).  This is followed by the Branches in the Feature Tree.
       Note the the sketch starts with a SKBEG statement.  This is
       followed by a SKVAR statement that specifies the initial
       locations of the various points in the sketch.  (These
       positions were automatically set up for you when you drew the
       sketch).  Following that , there is a series of SKCON
       statements that define the various constraints in the Sketcher.
       The first argument of each SKCON statement is the constraint
       type (which corresponds with the letters in the Sketcher),
       followed by the point (or segment) number and the value; again
       these were automatically set up for you when you drew the
       sketch and constrained it.  This is then followed by a series
       of LINSEG Branches, which say that our current sketch is made
       up of a series of line segments.  Again the number of the
       points to use in the LINSEG Branches was set up automatically
       for you.

    <p>Press "<strong>Cancel</strong>" to exit the editor and return
       to the normal view.

    <p>We are now going to create another sketch, which will be used
       to cut a hole in the bracket's left upright. This cut will be
       parameterized with a Design Parameter named "rad" whose sole
       value is "0.5".  (You can create that now.)

    <p>Now we want to create a new sketch.  We do this by adding a
       SKBEG Branch (with all "0" arguments).

    <p>The sketch that we are going to create consists of a
       race-track-shape curve, as shown in:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig34.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>This is done with the following actions. Draw a horizontal
       segment off to the right (make sure the line from the last
       point is drawn in orange) and press "<strong>L</strong>" (or
       click the mouse) to create the first horizontal segment.  Then
       move the mouse up and press the "<strong>C</strong>" key to
       create a circular arc segment.  When you have done that, the
       segment that you just created turns red and follows the cursor;
       move the cursor and see how it changes.  Once it is located at
       approximately the correct location, press the mouse button.
       Then sketch the horizontal line segment to the left, a circular
       arc on the left end, and finally a line segment back to the
       original point.

    <p>You might be wondering why the bottom of the racetrack was
       created with two LINSEGs.  The reason is that we are
       ultimately going to want to center the sketch on the left-leg
       of the bracket, so having a point at the "center" of the sketch
       will be convenient.

    <p>We are now going to constrain the sketch as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>"L" constraint on bottom-left horizontal segment set to
          "rad"</li>
        <li> "L" constraint on bottom-right horizontal segment set to
          "rad"</li>
        <li>"R" constraint on the right-hand circle set to "rad" (that
          is, you set the circular arc's radius)</li>
        <li>"T" constraint (tangency) at the point at the bottom of
          the left-hand arc</li>
        <li>"T" constraint (tangency) at the point at the bottom of
          the right-hand arc</li>
        <li>"T" constraint (tangency) at the point at the top of the
          left-hand arc</li>
        <li>"T" constraint (tangency) at the point at the top of the
          right-hand arc</li>
      </ul>

    <p>"<strong>Press to Solve</strong>", zoom in (using the
       "<strong>+</strong>" button) and center the sketch in the
       window (using the "<strong>H</strong>") button, yielding:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig35.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>"<strong>Sketch</strong>" and "<strong>Save</strong>" and
       "<strong>Press to Re-build</strong>". If you turn the
       configuration around, you will see the sketch at the back left
       bottom corner, as in:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig36.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>We want to rotate this to be parallel with the <em>y-z</em>
       plane by adding a ROTATEY Branch (with arguments "90", "0",
       "0"), move it to its proper location by adding a TRANSLATE
       Branch (with arguments "0", "height-3*rad", and "depth/2").  If
       you "<strong>Press to Re-build</strong>" you will see that the
       sketch is now properly positioned.  We can then add an
       EXTRUDE Branch (with arguments "length/2", "0", and "0") and
       finally subtract that new volume by adding a SUBTRACT Branch
       (with the default arguments).  If you "<strong>Press to
       Re-build</strong>", you should get:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig37.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Now we will add a chamfer at the edges of the cut-out that the
       just made.  Add a Design Parameter named "filrad" whose sole
       value is "0.1" and a new CHAMFER Branch whose arguments are
       "filrad" and "0" (meaning all Edges).  "<strong>Press to
       Re-build</strong>", yielding:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig38.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>We are now going to make another cut-out for the right leg of
       the bracket.  As usual, make a SKBEG Branch (with all zero
       arguments). The figure that we want to sketch looks like:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig39.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>To make this, start by drawing a horizontal line segment to the
       right (by pressing the "<strong>L</strong>" key).  We are now
       going to set the control points for a Bezier curve.  Do this by
       moving the cursor above the original point and pressing
       "<strong>B</strong>".  We then continue to add one
       "<strong>B</strong>" to the left, one below it (to the left of
       the original point) and one halfway back to the original point.
       Finally move the cursor over the original point (the one
       labeled "XY") and press "<strong>L</strong>".

    <p>You can put the cursor over any of the points and "drag" it to a
       new location.  This movement will effect the display, but will
       likely be over-written when the sketch is ultimately solved.

    <p>Constrain the sketch as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>"L" constraint on bottom-left horizontal segment set to
          "depth/4"</li>
        <li>"L" constraint on bottom-center horizontal segment set to
          "depth/4"</li>
        <li>"L" constraint on bottom-right horizontal segment set to
          "depth/4"</li>
        <li>"L" constraint on top horizontal segment set to
          "depth/2"</li>
        <li>"L" constraint on left segment set to "depth/4"</li>
      </ul>

    <p>"<strong>Press to Solve</Strong>", "<strong>Sketch</strong>",
      "<strong>Save</strong>", and "<strong>Press to Re-build</strong>".
      You should see:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig40.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Again, we want to rotate and translate the sketch, extrude it, and
       subtract it, by adding the Branches:
      <ul>
        <li>ROTATEY with arguments "90", "0", and "0"</li>
        <li>TRANSLATE with arguments "length", "height-3*rad", and
          "depth/2"</li>
        <li>EXTRUDE with arguments "-length/2", "0", and "0"</li>
        <li>SUBTRACT with arguments "none", "1", and "0"</li>
      </ul>

    <p>"<strong>Press to Re-build</strong>", giving:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig41.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Finally, we want to modify the original bracket to put fillets
       along the bottom of the slot.  To do this, we have to go back
       and add a FILLET Branch immediately after the EXTRUDE that
       created the bracket.  If we look back through the Feature Tree,
       we see the first EXTRUDE is at "Branch_000103".  (To verify
       this, select "Branch_000103" and "Build to this Branch").  We
       are going to want to add a FILLET statement after this Branch,
       but first we must determine the identity of the Edges that we
       want filleted.  To do this, press the "<strong>+</strong>" to
       the left of the Body (near the bottom of the "Tree" window), turn
       the visibility of the Faces off (press "<strong>Viz</strong>"
       to the right of Faces), and query the two Edges shown in:

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig42.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Identifying them is done by pressing "<strong>^</strong>" over
       the two Edges.  (In the picture above, these Edges were
       identified for you by turning their "<strong>Grd</strong>" on
       before capturing the screen; these Edges will likely not be
       highlighted on your screen.)  You will notice in the "Messages"
       window that the Branches have an "edgeID" set to "11 6 11 7 1"
       and "11 7 11 8 1".  This means (for example) that the first
       Edge was created at the intersection of Faces 6 and 7 of Body
       11.

    <p>We can now create the FILLET Branch (edit "Branch_000103" and
       press "<strong>Add new Branch after this Branch</strong>"),
       with arguments "filrad" (which was set above for the CHAMFER)
       and "6;7;7;8;" (which selects the Edges between Faces 6 and 7
       and between 7 and 8.  "<strong>Press to Re-build</strong>".

    <p>Finally, we might want to see the sensitivity of this
       configuration with respect to some of the Design
       Parameters. This is done exactly as in the first tutorial (by
       selecting a Design Parameter and pressing "<strong>Compute
       sensitivity</strong>").

    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig43.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>We can now save our <code>.csm</code> file by choosing
       "<strong>File->Export FeatureTree</strong>" with the filename
       "<code>../data/tutorial2</code>".  Close the browser and
       serveCSM should close automatically.

    <p><h3 id="sec2.3">2.3 Third tutorial: Aircraft example</h3>

    <p>For the third tutorial, we will start <code>serveCSM</code>
       with the file <code>data/tutorial3.csm</code>, which represents
       a fighter-like aircraft using blends and ruled surfaces.

    <p>Start <code>serveCSM</code> with commands such as
      <pre>
        serveCSM ../data/tutorial3 -dumpEgads
      </pre>
      After a few minutes, the following will appear:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig44.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>The <code>-dumpEgade</code> tells <code>serveCSM</code> to dump
       a file with the name <code>Body_xxxxxx.egads</code> whenever a
       new Body is created; here, <code>xxxxxx</code> is replaced with
       the current Body number.  This is a very useful option to use
       if you have a long build and want to "see" the current process
       (in another invocation of <code>serveCSM</code> (which uses a
       different port number).  It is also useful in conjunction with
       the <code>-loadEgads</code> option described below.

    <p>We are going to modify this case by using the
       "<strong>File->Edit</strong>" button.  Pressing it gives:
    <p><img src="pictures/ESP-fig45.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Listed in the "Graphics" window is a listing of
       the <code>tutorial3.csm</code> file.  We will dissect this file
       in a few minutes.  But first, edit the file by adding the
       following after line 2:
      <pre>
        # this is an added line
      </pre>

    <p>If you now press the "<strong>Cancel</strong>" button, the change
       you made will not be saved and the original aircraft picture
       will appear.  To see this, press the "<strong>File->Edit</strong>"
       button again and you will see that we have the
       original <code>tutorial3.csm</code> file.  Now edit the file by
       adding the following after line 2:
      <pre>
        # this is another added line
      </pre>
       Press the "<strong>ExportFeatureTree</strong>" button and the
       file will be updated and the configuration will rebuild with
       the updated file.  (This happens now even though the changes
       were inconsequential because all we did is added a comment.)

    <p>Now add a new Design Parameter called "xyz" that has 1 row and
       3 columns, with the values "11", "22", and "33". (Recall that
       this done by clicking on "<strong>Design Parameters</strong>"
       in the "Tree" window.)

    <p>If we try to "<strong>File->Edit</strong>" the file
       again, <code>ESP</code> will inform you that you made changes
       interactively and that you must save those changes first (or
       else lose them).  "<strong>Cancel</strong>" out of this and
       then press the <strong>"File->Export FeatureTree"</strong>
       button and give the new file the name "<code>foo</code>".

    <p>If you now press "<strong>File->Edit</strong>", you will see
       that the new current file is <code>foo.csm</code>.  You will
       also see that this file is formatted differently from your
       original <code>tutorial3.csm</code> file.  For example, the
       arguments in <code>foo.csm</code> are not nicely spaced as they
       were in the original <code>tutorial3.csm</code> file.  As a
       result, you will probably find it easier to only make changes
       via the user interface (as you did in tutorial 1) or to edit
       the file directly using the "<strong>File->Edit</strong>"
       button.  You can now "<strong>Cancel</strong>" out of the
       editor, bringing back the picture of the airplane.

    <p>In addition to understanding how
       to "<strong>Edit</strong>" <code>.csm</code> files, this tutorial
       also describes best practices when writing a <code>.csm</code>
       file.  So let's now dissect the
       original <code>tutorial3.csm</code> file.

    <p>As a good practice, it is suggested that you add comments to
     the top of the file, such as:

      </pre>

    <p>Notice the SET statements that compute Local Variables in
       terms of the Design Variables.  For example, the mean-chord of
       the horizontal tail (<code>cbar_h</code>) is computed as the
       square-root of the ratio of the tail area and the tail aspect
       ratio.

    <p>Now we are going to build the fuselage.  This will be done
       using by blending data from various cross-sections.  The
       sections that will ultimately be blended are those created after
       the previous MARK.  Creating the mark is done with the code:
      <!-- extract from tutorial3.csm -->
      <pre>
# build the fuselage
mark
      </pre>

    <p>We want to begin the fuselage at a point.  This is accomplished
       by using a POINT statement:
      <!-- extract from tutorial3.csm -->
      <pre>
   point     0  0  0
      </pre>
       This creates a point at the origin.

    <p>Then we need to generate the remaining 15 cross-sections.  This
       is done with a "pattern" (similar to a "for" loop in other
       programming languages):
      <!-- extract from tutorial3.csm -->
      <pre>
   patbeg    i  fuse.nrow
      udprim ellipse   ry  abs(fuse[i,2])  rz  (fuse[i,4]-fuse[i,3])/2
      translate        fuse[i,1]  0            (fuse[i,4]+fuse[i,3])/2
   patend
      </pre>
       Within the pattern we create an ellipse (using the "ellipse"
       user-defined primitive) with its Parameters taken from the
       second, third, and fourth columns of the <code>fuse</code>
       Design Parameter.  Each cross-section is then translated into
       its final position using the TRANSLATE statement.
       The <code>patend</code> statement closes the pattern.  (Although
       not used here, it is possible to enclose patterns within
       patterns.)

    <p>Finally we will generate the fuselage by blending the point and
       15 sections (everything since the <code>mark</code>) using:
      <!-- extract from tutorial3.csm -->
      <pre>
blend     noseList
      </pre>

    <p>At this point it is worth looking into
       the <code>noseList</code>.  The first four entries (the first
       row) contain the nose radius in the direction specified (in
       this case, "0,1,0", which is a vector in the "y"-direction).
       The next four entries contain the nose radius in the "0,0,1"
       direction (which is the "z"-direction).  Similar coding would
       be used at the tail if a <code>tailList</code> had been
       specified as the second argument in the <code>BLEND</code>
       command.

    <p>The wing is built in a similar manner using a ruled surface.
       The code here is:
      <!-- extract from tutorial3.csm -->
      <pre>
# build the wing
mark
   udprim    naca      Series    series_w
   rotatez   -wing[3,5]   0   0
   rotatex   90           0   0
   scale     wing[3,4]
   translate wing[3,1]    -wing[3,2]   wing[3,3]

   udprim    naca      Series    series_w
   rotatez   -wing[2,5]   0   0
   rotatex   90           0   0
   scale     wing[2,4]
   translate wing[2,1]    -wing[2,2]   wing[2,3]

   udprim    naca      Series    series_w
   rotatez   -wing[1,5]   0   0
   rotatex   90           0   0
   scale     wing[1,4]
   translate wing[1,1]    wing[1,2]   wing[1,3]

   udprim    naca      Series    series_w
   rotatez   -wing[2,5]   0   0
   rotatex   90           0   0
   scale     wing[2,4]
   translate wing[2,1]    +wing[2,2]   wing[2,3]

   udprim    naca      Series    series_w
   rotatez   -wing[3,5]   0   0
   rotatex   90           0   0
   scale     wing[3,4]
   translate wing[3,1]    +wing[3,2]   wing[3,3]
rule
      </pre>
       Notice here that instead of using a pattern, the five sections
       were explicitly created; this was done to ensure that the left
       and right wings were the same.  Also note that
       the <code>naca</code> user-defined primitive was used to
       generate the cross-sections.

    <p>The next statement:
      <!-- extract from tutorial3.csm -->
      <pre>
union   # with fuselage
      </pre>
       combines the fuselage and wing into a single Body.

    <p>The code for the tails is:
      <!-- extract from tutorial3.csm -->
      <pre>
# build the horizontal tail
mark
   udprim    naca      Series    series_h
   rotatez   -atip_h   0         0

   translate xtip_v    0         ztip_v

      </pre>

    <p>The <code>tutorial3.csm</code> file completes with the
       statement:
      <!-- extract from tutorial3.csm -->
      <pre>
end
      </pre>
       Although such a statement is not required, it is good practice
       to use it.

    <p>Feel free to experiment by modifying this file.

    <p>Finally we are going to run <code>serveCSM</code> with
       the <code>-loadEgads</code> option, as in:
      <pre>
serveCSM ../data/tutorial3 -loadEgads
      </pre>

    <p>This will rerun the <code>tutorial3</code> case, but will read
       Bodys from the <code>Body_xxxxxx.egads</code> files instead of
       generating, generally making it much faster.  Checks are made
       to ensure that the <code>Body_xxxxxx.egads</code> files match
       the expected Branch type and arguments.

    <p><h2 id="sec3">3.0: Command Line</h2>

    <p>To start <code>serveCSM</code>, one uses the command:
      <!-- extract from serveCSM.c -->
      <pre>
        serveCSM [casename[.csm]] [options...]
           where [options...] = -addVerify
                                -batch
                                -checkMass

                                -despmtrs despname
                                -dict dictname
                                -dumpEgads
                                -egg eggname
                                -help  -or-  -h
                                -histDist dist
                                -jrnl jrnlname
                                -loadEgads
                                -onormal
                                -outLevel X
                                -plot plotfile
                                -plotBDF BDFname
                                -plotCP
                                -plugs npass
                                -port X
                                -printStack
                                -ptrb ptrbname
                                -sensTess
                                -skipBuild
                                -skipTess
                                -verify
                                -version  -or-  -v  -or-  --version
      </pre>

    <p>The <code>-addVerify</code> option tells <code?serveCSM</code>
       to write a <code>.csm_verify</code> file that contains
       information about the Bodys on the stack.  This information can
       be used in a subsequent call (using the <code>-verify</code>
       flag) to verify that the results are "close enough" to a
       previous run.

    <p>If the <code>-batch</code> option is given,
       <code>serveCSM</code> is started without any graphical user
       interface.  This option is useful for regenerating
       configurations as part of a bigger process, such as for testing
       or within an MDAO environment.

    <p>The <code>-dict</code> option tells <code>serveCSM</code> to
       read the <code>dictname</code> file to define constant
       Parameters that should be defined before the configuration is
       built.  The format of the <code>dictname</code> file is a
       series of lines, where each line contains a constant name and a
       value, separated by white space; these Parameters are defined
       after the <code>.csm</code> is read but before it is executed.

    <p>The <code>-dumpEgads</code> option tells <code>serveCSM</code>
       to write an EGADS file named "Body_xxxxxx.egads" to the current
       working directory every time a new Body is built.  This option
       is useful if one wants to see the progress so far during a long
       build or in conjunction with the <code>-loadEgads</code>
       option.

    <p>The <code>-egg</code> option tells <code>serveCSM</code> to use
       the <code>eggname</code> external grid generator instead of the
       built-in <code>EGADS</code> tessellator.

    <p>The <code>-help</code> option produces a listing of the command
       line options.

    <p>the <code>-histDist</code> option produces a histogram of the
       distances of all point in a plotfile (specified with
       the <code>-plot</code> option) from the current configuration.

    <p>The <code>-jrnl</code> option is useful for replaying a
       previous session.  This journal file is an ASCII file that can
       be created with any text-editor.  But more typically, a user
       modifies the <code>portX.jrnl</code> file that is automatically
       produced every time <code>serveCSM</code> is started.  (Note:
       be sure to copy and/or rename this file before using it as an
       input to <code>serveCSM</code>, since the
       next <code>serveCSM</code> will overwrite this file.)

    <p>The<code>-loadEgads</code> option tells <code>serveCSM</code>
       to try to read file named "Body_xxxxxx.egads" during the build
       process, thereby bypassing possibly long operations.  There are
       safeguards to ensure that the Branch type and arguments match
       before the file is loaded.

    <p>The <code>-onormal</code> option tells <code>serveCSM</code> to
       move the user's eye away from the configuration, making the
       display almost orthonormal (instead of perspective).

    <p>The <code>-outLevel</code> option sets the level of output (0
       to 3) that the server should produce during its execution.
       Higher numbers are useful for debugging and should seldom be
       used by most users.

    <p>The <code>-plot</code> option provides a <code>plotfile</code>
       file that contains X,Y,Z triplets of points to be plotted in
       ESP with the label <code>plotdata</code>.
       See <a href="#sec5.12">Section 5.12</a> for details.

    <p>The <code>-plotBDF</code> option plots the GRIDs, CRODs, and
       CQUAD4s in the associated <code>.bdf</code> file (which can be
       written by the <code>createBEM</code> UDP).

    <p>The <code>-plotCP</code> option plots the control polygons
       associated with all Bspline Faces.

    <p>The <code>-plugs</code> option starts Plugs, which is a tool
       for modifying the DESPMTRs in a configuration so that the
       distances from the points in a plotfile (specified via
       the <code>-plot</code> option) to the configuration is
       minimized in a least-squares sense.  This option is still
       experimental and should be used with caution.

    <p>The <code>-port</code> option tells <code>serveCSM</code> with
       which port to connect.  If a port other than the default is
       used, be certain to use that same port number
       in <code>ESP</code>'s initial prompt.

    <p>The <code>-printStack</code> option tells <code>OpenCSM</code>
        to print out the contents of the stack after every command is
        executed.

    <p>The <code>-sensTess</code> flag allows a user to select
       "configuration" sensitivities instead of the (default)
       "tessellation" sensitivities.

    <p>The <code>-skipBuild</code> flag tells <code>serveCSM</code> to
       skip the initial build.  This is useful when the user knows
       that some DESPMTRs will be changed before the build.

    <p>The <code>-skipTess</code> option is used when you want to
       run <code>OpenCSM</code> in <code>-batch</code> mode and you do
       not want it to create the tessellation of all the Bodys on the
       stack.

    <p>The <code>-verify</code> is typically used during testing to
       verify that the Bodys that are produced "match" those that were
       produced when the <code>-addVerify</code> flag was used.  It
       does this by actually checking the ASSERT Branches
       whose <code>verify</code> option is set to 1.

    <p>The <code>-version</code> (or <code>-v</code>
       or <code>--version</code>) flag is used to print version
       information for the user.

    <p><code>OpenCSM</code> ignores the <code>--</code> flag.

    <p>The options <code>-checkMass</code>, <code>-checkPara</code>,
       <code>-despmtrs</code> and <code>-ptrb</code> are basically
       used during development, and users should generally not need to
       use them.

    <p><h2 id="sec4">4.0: Interactive Options</h2>

    <p>The tutorial (above) gives an overview of nearly all the
       interactive commands that are available in <code>ESP</code>.
       Future versions of this document will add more details here.

    <p>Back to <a href="#sec0">Table of Contents</a>

    <p><h2 id="sec5">5.0: Format of the <code>.csm</code>
        and <code>.udc</code> Files</h2>

    <p><h3 id="sec5.1">5.1: Format of the <code>.csm</code> file</h3>

    <p>The <code>.csm</code> file contains a series of statements.

    <p>If a line contains a hash (#), all characters starting at the
       hash are ignored.

    <p>If a line contains a backslash, all characters starting at the
       backslash are ignored and the next line is appended; spaces at
       the beginning of the next line are treated normally.

    <p>All statements begin with a keyword (described below) and must
       contain at least the indicated number of arguments.

    <p>The keywords may either be all lowercase or all UPPERCASE.

    <p>Any CSM statement can be used except the INTERFACE statement.

    <p>Blocks of statements must be properly nested.  The Blocks are
      bounded by PATBEG/PATEND, IFTHEN/ELSEIF/ELSE/ENDIF,
      SOLBEG/SOLEND, and CATBEG/CATEND.

    <p>Extra arguments in a statement are discarded.  If one wants to
       add a comment, it is recommended to begin it with a hash (#) in
       case optional arguments are added in future releases.

    <p>Any statements after an END statement are ignored.

    <p>All arguments must not contain any spaces or must be enclosed
       in a pair of double quotes (for example, "a + b").

    <p>Parameters are evaluated in the order that they appear in the
       file, using MATLAB-like syntax (see
       <a href="#sec5.10">'Expression rules'</a> below).

    <p>During the build process, <code>OpenCSM</code> maintains a LIFO
       'Stack' that can contain Bodies and Sketches.

    <p>The csm statements are executed in a stack-like way, taking
       their inputs from the Stack and depositing their results onto
       the Stack.

    <p>The default name for each Branch is 'Brch_xxxxxx', where xxxxxx
       is a unique sequence number.

    <p><h3 id="sec5.2">5.2: Format of the <code>.udc</code> file</h3>

    <p>A <code>.udc</code> file follows the rules of
       a <code>.csm</code> file, EXCEPT:

    <p>Zero or more INTERFACE statements must preceed any other
       non-comment statement.

    <p>Any CSM statement can be used except the DIMENSION, CONPMTR,
       DESPMTR, LBOUND, and UBOUND statements.

    <p>SET statements define parameters that are visible only within
       the <code>.udc</code> file (that is, parameters have local
       scope).

    <p>Parameters defined outside the <code>.udc</code> file are not
       available, except those passed in via INTERFACE statements.

    <p><code>.udc</code> files can be nested to a depth of 10 levels.

    <p><code>.udc</code> files are executed via a UDPRIM statement.

        <li>command name can eiter be UPPERCASE or lowercase, but not
          mixed</li>
        <li>arguments that start with a dollar-sign ($) are character
          strings.  Note that the user does not type the
          dollar-sign.  If you want to use a string-valued expression
          instead of an implicit string, start the argument with an
          exclamation point (!).</li>
        <li> arguments without a dollar sign ($) can be either a
          numeric value, a variable name, or an expression</li>
        <li>the default values for arguments are shown after the
          equal-signs</li>
        <li>arguments that take a list can either refer to a
          multi-valued Parameter or can be a semi-colon-separated list
          of values and/or expressions</li>

    <p><h3 id="sec5.12">5.12: Format of plotfile</h3>

    <p>A plotfile is a file that is specified via the
      <code>-plot</code> command line option
      to <code>serveCSM</code>.
      The contents of this file is used for either plotting in
      <code>ESP</code> and/or as input for the <code>-histDist</code>
      or <code>-plugs</code> command line options.

      The plotfile contains a series of blocks of data with the
      format:
      <pre>
        imax  jmax  name
      </pre>
      The <code>name</code> is a character string (without white
      spaces) that will be listed in the <code>ESP</code> Display
      list; this name must be unique.  The meaning of
      <code>imax</code> and <code>jmax</code> depends on the type
      of data, as described below.

    <h4>Series of points</h4>
    <p>Here <code>imax</code> is the number points
      and <code>jmax</code> must be <code>0</code>.  This is also the
      data block type used by the <code>-histDist</code>
      and <code>-plugs</code> options.  There are <code>imax</code>
      3-D coordinates.

    <h4>Polyline</h4>
    <p>Here <code>imax</code> is the number points in the line
      and <code>jmax</code> must be <code>1</code>.  There are
      <code>imax</code> 3-D coordinates specified.

    <h4>Series of 2-point lines</h4>
    <p>Here <code>imax</code> is the number 2-point lines
      and <code>jmax</code> must be <code>-1</code>.  There are two
      3-D coordinates for each line; that is, there are
      <code>2*imax</code> 3-D coordinates specified.

    <h4>Series of triangles</h4>
    <p>Here <code>imax</code> is the number triangles
      and <code>jmax</code> must be <code>-2</code>.  There are three
      3-D coordinates for each triangle; that is, there are
      <code>3*imax</code> 3-D coordinates specified.

    <h4>Grid of quadrilaterals</h4>
    <p>Here <code>imax</code> is the number i-lines (in the j
      direction) and <code>jmax</code> is the number of j-lines (in
      the i direction).  There are <code>imax*jmax</code> 3-D
      coordinates specified.

    <h4>End of data blocks</h4>
    <p>Here <code>imax</code> and <code>jmax</code> must
      be <code>0</code>.  Use of this block is optional.

    <p>Following the data block header is a series of 3-D coordinates
      specified as <code>x y z</code>.

    <p><h3 id="sec8.25"> 8.25: New/extended features in v1.06</h3>

    <p>User-defined components (UDCs) have been implemented to execute
       consistently with user-defined primitives (UDPs).  The main
       difference is that UDCs are defined in scripts (in a file named
       <code>*.udc</code>) whereas UDPs are defined in C-code that is
       pre-compiled.  The first argument of the UDPRIM statement
       selects a UDC if it starts with a "/" or a "$/"; otherwise it
       looks for a UDP.

    <p>The INTERFACE statement has been added to be used within UDCs
       to define the UDC's INTERFACE, including the default values for
       its arguments.

    <p>The JOIN command was added to combine Bodys at common Faces.
       Using the JOIN command is preferred over the UNION command
       when the user expects some of the Faces to match exactly.

    <p>The STORE and RESTORE commands were added to keep copies of
       Bodys in memory (rather than in an external files, as was done
       for DUMP and IMPORT).  The advantage is that the build tree
       information is retained, allowing Bodys to sometimes be reused
       during the regeneration process.

    <p>The EXTRACT command has been added to extract a
       lower-dimension object (for example, an Edge from a Body).

    <p>The COMBINE command has been added to create a
       higher-dimension object (for example, a Faces from a group of
       Edges).

    <p>The ASSERT command has been added to return an error if
       the assertion is not satisfied.

    <p>The direction vectors in the "noselist" and "taillist"
       arguments to the BLEND command no longer need to be
       normalized.

    <p>If the arguments to the SUBTRACT command are a SOLID Body and
       a SHEET Body, then the SOLID Body is scribed with Edges at the
       intersection of the SOLID and SHEET.

    <p>An optional argument (wireonly) has been added to the SKEND
       command; if wireonly is set to 1, then a (possibly non-planar)
       WIRE Body is created instead of a SHEET Body.

    <p>Array elements can be addressed with a single subscript, which
       are numbered across rows.

    <p>Names are allowed to include colons ":", which is useful for
       hierarchically organizing names.

    <p>The "ifnan", "sign", "ceil", and "floor" functions have been
       added to the expression evaluator.

    <p>".nrow", ".ncol", ".size", ".sum", ".min", and ".max"
       dot-suffixes can be appended to variables to return properties
       of the Design Parameter of Local Variable rather than its
       value.

    <p>The "naca456" UDP was added to create NACA-4, -5, and -6 series
       airfoils.

    <p>Global Attributes are placed on all Bodys.

    <p>Keyboard shortcuts were added to the <code>ESP</code> viewer:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>&lt;Ctrl-h&gt;</strong></td>

    <p><h2 id="sec12">12.0: Glossary</h2>

      <p><strong>@-parameter</strong> A local variable that is set by
      the system every time a new Body is created or a SELECT
      statement is executed.  The local variables, which cannot be set
      by the user, contain information such as the identity of various
      entities or mass properties.

      <p><strong>argument</strong> An expression that is input to an
      CSM statement.  Arguments are positional (that is, their
      meanings are specified by their order).  Optional arguments are
      listed last, and their default values are listed in the
      command's description.

      <p><strong>associative</strong> A concept that means that an
      entity in one Body is another representation of some other
      entity in some other Body.

      <p><strong>autosave.csm</strong> A file that contains a snapshot
      of the state of ESP before any command is executed.

      <p><strong>Attribute</strong> A user-defined name/value pair
      that is associated with a Branch, Body, Face, Edge, or Node.
      Names that begin with an underscore (_) have special meaning to
      CSM and those that begin with a period (.) have special meaning
      to EGADS.  The values associated an attribute can either be a
      string value (prepended by a dollar-sign ($)) or a
      semicolon-separated list of expressions.

      <p><strong>activity</strong> An characteristic of a Branch which
      tells if the Branch should be executed the next time the Model
      is re-built.  ESP supports 'active' and 'suppressed' activities.

      <p><strong>Body</strong> An object that is created by ESP to
      represent some physical artifact.  ESP supports SolidBodys,
      SheetBodys (which consist of a collection of connected Faces
      that may or may not be manifold), WireBodys (which consist of a
      collection of connected Edges, where each Edge shares a bounding
      Node with at most one other Edge), and NodeBodys (which consist
      of a single point in space).

      <p><strong>Boolean operation</strong> An operation that combines
      two Bodys (on the stack).  The UNION operation returns the
      fusion of two Bodys, the INTERSECT operation returns the common
      part of two Bodys, and the SUBTRACT operation returns the
      portion of Body1 that is not in Body2.

      <p><strong>Branch</strong> An entity in the Model's Feature
      Tree that corresponds to either a primitive solid,
      transformation, Boolean operator, sketch entity, or other
      item used in the construction of a Model.

      <p><strong>Brep</strong> A boundary representation is a
      collections of Nodes, Edges, and Faces that describe the
      boundary of a Body.

      <p><strong>browser</strong> A computer program with which a user
      interacts with ESP.  ESP currently runs in FireFox and SeaMonkey.

      <p><strong>client</strong> A program, typically a web browser,
      with which a user interacts.  The client handles some of ESP's
      operations directly (such as image manipulation), but sends
      messages to the server to perform the majority of ESP's
      operations.

      <p><strong>collapse</strong> The process of 'closing up' a node
      in a tree so that its children are not displayed.  This is
      accomplished by pressing the <strong>-</strong> to the left of
      an (expanded) tree node.

      <p><strong>command</strong> Synonym for statement.

      <p><strong>command line</strong> The statement typed into a
      terminal window to start <code>serveCSM</code>.

      <p><string>Configuation Parameter</strong> A value that can be
      set by the user, either programmatically or via the ESP user
      interface, that is used to generate a specific instance of a
      model.  Sensitivities cannot can be found with respect to a
      Configuration Parameter.

      <p><strong>constructive solid modeler</strong> A process by
      which complex Bodys are created through the combination of
      simpler (primitive) Bodys.

      <p><strong>curve</strong> A path through space, where the
      locations of points along the curve are given as [x,y,z]=f(t),
      where t is called the parametric coordinate.  Examples of curves
      include lines, conics, and NURBS curves.

      <p><strong>degree of freedom</strong> A variable in a sketch
      whose value must be computed by satisfying one or more
      constraints.  Each line in a sketch adds 2 degrees of freedom,
      each circular arc adds 3 degrees of freedom, ...

      <p><strong>dot-suffix</strong> A mechanism through which some
      property of a (multi-values) Parameter or Variable is returns
      (rather than the Parameter's value).  For
      example, <code>x.nrow</code> returns the number of rows
      of <code>x</code>.

      <p><strong>drag</strong> An operation in which a user presses a
      mouse button and holds it down while moving it to another
      location on the screen.

      <p><strong>Design Parameter</strong> A value that can be set by
      the user, either programmatically or via the ESP user interface,
      that is used to generate a specific instance of a model.
      Sensitivities of the configuration or tessellation can be found
      with respect to any Design Parameter.

      <p><strong>Design Velocity</strong> A change in an input
      parameter from which changes in the local surface normals will
      be computed.

      <p><strong>Edge</strong> The part of a Brep that is associated
      with a curve.  Each Edge has an underlying curve, the parametric
      coordinate (tbeg) at the beginning of the Edge, the parametric
      coordinate (tend) at the end of the Edge, and the Nodes at tbeg
      and tend.  If all the Edges in a Body support exactly two Faces,
      the Body is said to be manifold.

      <p><strong>EGADS</strong> The Electronic Geometry Aircraft
      Design System, is an open-source geometry interface
      to <code>OpenCASCADE</code>, in which the functionality
      in <code>OpenCASCADE</code> that is needed for construction of
      typical applications is incorporated into about 70 C-functions.

      <p><strong>ESP</strong> The Engineering Sketch Pad is a
      browser-based software system that allows users create, modify,
      (re-)build, and save constructive solid models built via OpenCSM.

      <p><strong>expand</strong> The process of 'opening up' a node in
      a tree to see its children nodes.  This is accomplished by
      pressing the <strong>+</strong> to the left of a (collapsed)
      tree node.

      <p><strong>expression</strong> An algebraic combination of
      variables and constants that produce a single number.
      Expressions can use any of OpenCSM's built-in functions and/or
      dot-suffixes.  Expressions are used as argument to OpenCSM's
      commands.

      <p><strong>Face</strong> The part of a Brep that is associated
      with a surface.  Faces are bounded by trimming curves in the
      form of Loops.  Each Face has only one outer Loop and zero or
      more inner Loops (which represent holes).  The trimming curves,
      which corresponds to the Face's bounding Edges, are described
      as a series of Pcurves.

      <p><strong>Feature Tree</strong> A build prescription that is
      made up of a series of statements (or commands).  The statements
      in the Feature Tree are executed sequentially (with loops being
      represented by patterns and logic represented by IFTHEN
      blocks).  During the execution of the Feature Tree, a stack of
      Bodys are maintained.  Each statement that generates a Body puts
      it onto the stack; statements that modify or combine Bodys get
      their inputs by popping Bodys off the stack (with the most
      recently created being popped off first).  When CSM completes,
      the Bodys that remain on the stack are available as output of
      CSM.

      <p><strong>flying mode</strong> A way of panning, zooming, and
      rotating a display in which the motion of the image in the
      Graphics Window changes as long as the user holds the mouse
      button.  Use the <strong>!</strong> key in the Graphics Window
      to toggle flying mode on and off.

      <p><strong>function</strong> An atomic operation that transforms
      its inputs into a single value.  Example include trigonometric
      operations and single in-line logical constructs.

      <p><strong>global Attribute</strong> An Attribute that is
      specified before any other CSM command.  Global Attributes are
      added to any Body created by CSM.

      <p><strong>Graphics window</strong> The window on the top-right
      of the ESP screen that contains a graphical representation of
      the current configuration.

      <p><strong>hostname</strong> The name of the computer that is
      running the server (typically serveCSM).  If using a single
      computer for both the browser and server, use 'Localhost' as the
      hostname.

      <p><strong>journal</strong> A file that is written (on the
      server) that keeps track of the commands that user executed
      while running ESP.  A user (who has access to the server) can
      copy the journal file to another name and use it to
      automatically replay the session that was journalled during a
      future invocation of serveCSM.

      <p><strong>Key window</strong> The window on the bottom left of
      the ESP screen that contains a spectrum to indicate sensitivity
      values.  If no sensitivity is active, this window in blank.

      <p><strong>Local Variable</strong> Either an array of numeric
      values (which can contain only one value, in which case it is
      called a scalar) or a string of characters.  Local variables get
      their values via SET and GETATTR statements.  Local variables
      are not accessible outside CSM, but only within CSM while the
      Feature Tree is being executed.

      <p><strong>Loop</strong> A collection of Edges, arranged end to
      end, where each Edge has exactly two neighboring Edges.  Loops,
      when applied to a surface, tells the part of the surface that is
      inside the Face.

      <p><strong>manifold solid</strong> A manifold solid is
      represented by a Brep, whose Edges all support two Faces.

      <p><strong>Messages window</strong> The window on the bottom
      right of the ESP screen that contains status information and
      other messages to the user.

      <p><strong>Model</strong> A container that contains the
      Parameters and (Feature Tree) Branches.

      <p><strong>Node</strong> The topological entity associated with
      a single location in space.  Nodes can be free-standing, such as
      in a NodeBody, but usually are at the ends of Edges.

      <p><strong>OpenCASCADE</strong> An open-source geometry system
      on which EGADS is built.

      <p><strong>OpenCSM</strong> The open-source constructive solid
      modeler that is a feature-based, associative, and parametric and
      which build Bodys that are either manifold solids (the typical
      output) or non-manifold sheets and wires (such as may be needed
      for representing wake sheets and antennae).

      <p><strong>Parameter</strong> A two-dimensional array of
      floating-point numbers that is used during the build process to
      generate a specific instance of a Model.

      <p><strong>pattern</strong> A looping construct, originally used
      to generate a series of features on a Body (such as a
      regularly-space series of holes).

      <p><strong>point</strong> A location in space either at a Node,
      along an Edge (or curve), or on a Face (or surface).

      <p><strong>port</strong> The port number on which the server
      (typically serveCSM) is listening for requests by the browser.
      serveCSM uses 7681 as its default port.

      <p><strong>primitive</strong> A CSM statement that generates
      either a box, sphere, cylinder, cone, or torus, or a
      user-defined primitive.

      <p><strong>semicolon-separated list</strong> A list of
      expressions (that evaluate to numeric values) that are written
      with semicolons (;) between entries.  A semicolon-separated list
      may optionally be terminated with a semicolon.

      <p><strong>sensitivity</strong> The derivative of the location
      on a Body with respect to one or more of the Design Parameters.

      <p><strong>server</strong> A computer program in which OpenCSM
      runs and which 'serves' Models and Boundary Representations to
      ESP.  The program 'serveCSM' is the initial server for ESP.

      <p><strong>sketch</strong> A 2-D drawing composed of lines,
      circular arcs, a splines, that is used to define a SheetBody
      (with a single Face) or WireBody.  Sketches are typically used
      as the basis of grown solids such as EXTRUDE, REVOLVE, RULE, and
      BLEND.  (The latter two of these actually use a series of
      sketches.)

      <p><strong>sketch constraint</strong> A rule for specifying the
      relationships between sketch variables.

      <p><strong>sketch variable</strong> A degree of freedom within a
      sketch.  There are two sketch variables associated with the
      point between each pair of sketch segments and one additional
      sketch variable associated with each circular arc segment.

      <p><strong>stack</strong> A construct used with the build
      process to establish parent-child relationships between various
      features in the Feature Tree.  Primitive statements, which create
      Bodys, push them onto the top of the stack.  Transformation
      statements pop the top Body (or group) from the stack, transform
      it/them, and then pushes the transformed result back onto the
      stack.  Boolean operation pop two (or more) Bodys from the top
      of the stack and push the resultant Body back onto the stack.

      <p><strong>statement</strong> A line of CSM code that
      corresponds to one of the steps in the build process in the
      Feature Tree.

      <p><strong>suppressed</strong> A possible state for a Branch;
      Branches that are suppressed are not executed when the Feature
      Tree is executed.  Suppression is typically used to temporarily
      remove a feature during a build.

      <p><strong>surface</strong> A sheet in space, where the
      locations of points on the surface are given as [x,y,z]=f(u,v),
      where u and v are called the parametric coordinates.  Examples
      of surfaces include planes, cylindrical surface, and
      tensor-product NURBS surfaces.

      <p><strong>transformation</strong> A type of CSM statement that
      pops a Body (or group) from the top of the stack, modifies it,
      and then pushes the modified Body (or group) back onto the
      stack.  Examples of transformations include TRANSLATE, ROTATE*,
      and SCALE.

      <p><strong>Tree window</strong> The window on the top-left of
      the ESP screen that contains command buttons, a tree-like view
      of the current Parameters, a tree-like view of the current
      Branches (of the Feature Tree), and a tree-like view of the
      display settings.

      <p><strong>UDC</strong> User-defined component.  This is
      essentially a macro that is stored in a .udc file.  It is
      execute with a UDPRIM statement, where the primtype either
      starts with / or $/

      <p><strong>UDF</strong> User-defined function.  The difference
      between a UDF and a UDP is that a UDP does not get any of its
      inputs from the stack, whereas a UDF consumes one or more Bodys
      from the stack.

      <p><strong>UDP</strong> User-defined primitive.  This is a
      user-supplied compiled file (from C or FORTRAN) that creates a
      non-standard primitive.  It is executed with a UDPRIM statement,
      where the primtype starts with a letter

      <p><strong>WebViewer</strong> A piece of software, built upon
      the standard WebGL, that allows for the real-time view angle
      changes in a browser.
