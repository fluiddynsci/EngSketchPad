# function-type UDC since it does not have an INTERFACE. ALL statement

# define the UDC's input arguments and their default values
INTERFACE firstArg   IN  0
INTERFACE secondArg  IN  0

# define the UDC's output arguments and their default values
INTERFACE theSum     OUT 0
INTERFACE theProduct OUT 0

# verify that this UDC does not have access to its parents variables
ASSERT    ifnan(A,1,0)  1

# set a local variable
SET       A  11

ASSERT    ifnan(A,1,0)  0

# perform the computations
SET       theSum      firstArg+secondArg
SET       theProduct  firstArg*secondArg

# the END statement is not required, but is a best practice
