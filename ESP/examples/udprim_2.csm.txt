# examples of calling a UDC (include-type user-defined component)

# make a box
BOX       0  0  0  1  1  1

# set some variables
SET       A  1
SET       B  2

# call a include-type UDC (has no arguments nor returns)

# note: the name of the UDP starts with $/, which means it is
#       in the same directory as this .csm file
UDPRIM    $/udprim_2

# make sure we get the updates which were made in the UDC
ASSERT    A  11
