/*
Node
    - a location in 3D space that serves as the terminus for one or
      more Edges

Edge
    - is associated with a 3D curve (if not degenerate)
    - has a range of parametric coordinates, where tmin <= t <= tmax
    - the positive orientation is going from tmin to tmax
    - has a Node for tmin and for tmax
    - if the Nodes at tmin and tmax are the same, the Edge forms a
      closed Loop (that is, is periodic) or is degenerate (if tmin
      equals tmax); otherwise it is open

Loop
    - free standing collection of one or more connected Edges with
      associated senses
    - if the Loop is closed, each of the corresponding Nodes is
      associated with exactly two Edges
    - if the Loop is open, the intermediate Nodes are each associated
      with two Edges and the Nodes at the ends each correspond to one
      Edge
    - the sense of the Loop is associated with the order of the Edges
      in the Loop and their associated senses

Face
    - a surface bounded by one or more Loops with associated senses
    - there may be only one outer Loop (sense = 1) and any number
      of inner Loops (sense = -1)
    - all associated Loops must be closed

Shell
    - a collection of one of more connected Faces
    - if all the Edges associated with a Shell are used by exactly two
      Faces in the Shell, the Shell is closed (manifold) and it
      segregates regionds of 3D space; otherwise the Shell is open

NODE  (NodeBody)
    - a single Node (which can be used as the terminus in operations
      such as RULE, BLEND, and LOFT)
    - formed by creating an empty Sketch

WIRE  (WireBody)
    - a single Loop

SHEET  (SheetBody)
    - a single Shell that can be either non-manifold (open) or manifold
      (closed)

SOLID  (SolidBody)
    - a manifold collection of one or more closed Shells with associated
      senses
    - there may be only one outer Shell (sense = 1) and any number of
      inner Shells (sense = -1)

/*
The .csm file contains a series of statements.

If a line contains a hash (#), all characters starting at the hash
   are ignored.

If a line contains a backslash, all characters starting at the
   backslash are ignored and the next line is appended; spaces at
   the beginning of the next line are treated normally.

All statements begin with a keyword (described below) and must
   contain at least the indicated number of arguments.

The keywords may either be all lowercase or all UPPERCASE.

Any CSM statement can be used except the INTERFACE statement.

Blocks of statements must be properly nested.  The Blocks are bounded
   by PATBEG/PATEND, IFTHEN/ELSEIF/ELSE/ENDIF, SOLBEG/SOLEND,
   and CATBEG/CATEND.

Extra arguments in a statement are discarded.  If one wants to add
   a comment, it is recommended to begin it with a hash (#) in case
   optional arguments are added in future releases.

Any statements after an END statement are ignored.

All arguments must not contain any spaces or must be enclosed
   in a pair of double quotes (for example, "a + b").

Parameters are evaluated in the order that they appear in the
   file, using MATLAB-like syntax (see 'Expression rules' below).

During the build process, OpenCSM maintains a LIFO 'Stack' that
   can contain Bodys and Sketches.

The csm statements are executed in a stack-like way, taking their
   inputs from the Stack and depositing their results onto the Stack.

The default name for each Branch is 'Brch_xxxxxx', where xxxxxx
   is a unique sequence number.

Special characters:
   #          introduces comment
   "          ignore spaces until following "
   \          ignore this and following characters and concatenate next line
   <space>    separates arguments in .csm file (except between " and ")

   0-9        digits used in numbers and in names
   A-Z a-z    letters used in names
   _ : @      characters used in names (see rule for names)
   ? % =      characters used in strings
   .          decimal separator (used in numbers), introduces dot-suffixes
                 (in names)
   ,          separates function arguments and row/column in subscripts
   ;          multi-value item separator
   ( )        groups expressions and function arguments
   [ ]        specifies subscripts in form [row,column] or [index]
   { } < >    characters used in strings
   + - * / ^  arithmetic operators
   $          as first character, introduces a string that is terminated
                 by end-of-line or un-escaped plus, comma, or open-bracket
   @          as first character, introduces @-parameters (see below)
   '          used to escape comma, plus, or open-bracket within strings
   !          if first character of implicit string, ignore $! and treat
                 as an expression

    UDC at global scope.

SET statements define parameters that are visible only within the .udc

Parameters defined outside the .udc file are not available, except those
   passed in via INTERFACE statements.

.udc files can be nested to a depth of 10 levels.
