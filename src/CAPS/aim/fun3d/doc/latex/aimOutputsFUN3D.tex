Force components\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Forces}} = Returns a tuple array of JSON string dictionaries of forces and moments for each boundary (combined forces also included). The structure for the Forces tuple = (\char`\"{}\+Boundary Name\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}\+Value\char`\"{}). \char`\"{}\+Boundary Name\char`\"{} defines the boundary/component name (or \char`\"{}\+Total\char`\"{}) and the \char`\"{}\+Value\char`\"{} is a JSON string dictionary. Entries in the dictionary are the same as the other output variables without \char`\"{}tot\char`\"{} in the name (e.\+g. CL, CD, CMX, CL\+\_\+p, CMX\+\_\+v, etc.).
