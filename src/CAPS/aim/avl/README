			CAPS / AVL Requirements

     If you have version 3.35 of AVL (if you wish to run the AIM). Update the
     file "ainput.f" from this directory into the src directory of the AVL 
     distribution. Build (or rebuild after the update) AVL by following the 
     instructions found within the AVL distribution. The bug has been fixed
     in AVL Rev 3.36.
