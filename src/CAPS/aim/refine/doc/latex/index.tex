A module in the Computational Aircraft Prototype Syntheses (CAPS) has been developed to interact with the unstructured mesh adaptation software \href{https://github.com/nasa/refine}{\texttt{ refine}}.

refine is designed primarily to interact with Fun3D, but provides more a generic interface as well. As of Fun3D 14, a set of scripts are provided to drive Fun3D solutions with refine, which are outlined in the Fun3D user manual. Using this AIM in lieu of the Fun3D scripts enables data transfer as well as parametric shape sensitivities in the CAPS framework.

An outline of the AIM\textquotesingle{}s inputs and outputs are provided in \mbox{\hyperlink{aimInputsRefine}{AIM Inputs}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{aimOutputsRefine}{AIM Outputs}}, respectively.

The refine AIM can automatically execute ref, with details provided in \mbox{\hyperlink{aimExecuteRefine}{AIM Execution}}. The specific executable can be changed with the \textquotesingle{}ref\textquotesingle{} input string.
