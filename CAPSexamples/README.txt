                 CAPS: Computational Aircraft Prototype Syntheses
                           Rev 1.24 -- January 2024
                                   Examples
                                

1. Prerequisites

    All the examples assume that the appropriate executables
    can be invoked via a system call (i.e. they are in the PATH
    environment variable). The one exception is the Astros
    examples, which use use the environment variable ASTROS_ROOT 
    (set to the path where Astros can be found) to locate Astros.
    The analysis tools xfoil and avl are provided with the distribution,
    and all other analysis software must be obtained elsewhere.
    
    The examples are provided in the cCAPS and pyCAPS sub-directories.
    File names indicate the analysis tools executed within the example.
    
    The bash scripts regressionTest/execute_CTestRegression.sh and
    regressionTest/execute_PyTestRegression.sh can be used to test
    the CAPS installation on OSX and Linux. Only examples where 
    the analysis software is found in the path are executed. 
    The scripts must be executed in the regressionTest directory.
